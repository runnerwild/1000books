        "text": "Written in the middle of the 1960s, yet composed largely from journals kept a decade earlier during the author’s summers as a backcountry ranger at the Arches National Monument (“among,” as he puts it, “the hoodoo rocks and voodoo silence of the Utah wilderness”), Desert Solitaire evokes the paradoxical loveliness of the harsh, hostile landscape with awestruck exactitude and visceral intensity. Edward\nAbbey’s attention to the desert flora and fauna, to the ancient rock formations and the ever-present weather, to the pleasures of both solitude and company, brings a bracing alertness to the episodes he describes in the linked essays that organize his narrative. Despite its canonization as something of a backpacker’s bible, Desert Solitaire is too quirky, cranky, and idiosyncratic to be stereotyped as a nature lover’s handbook. While the spare majesty of its setting provides a stunning inspiration for Abbey’s work, his meditations have as much to say about society, civilization, and culture as they do about nature.",

Square, a two-dimensional being in a world inhabited by lines, triangles, circles, and polygons. Ingeniously composed as a kind of dystopian memoir, Flatland is a stunning piece of social satire, depicting with great acuity the gender and class distinctions of Victorian Britain. Abbott’s notions about the larger conundrums posed by different dimensions and their relationships to one another were ahead of their time, mathematically speaking, but the enduring fascination of his fable is its depiction of the perils of making the world simpler than it is, no matter how elegantly provable that simplicity may seem.",

It is a short, sparely told tale that nevertheless embraces themes of enormous import: fate and will, the determining influences of familial inheritance, the consequences and consolations of custom, the legacy of colonialism. It also illuminates the personal and political crises provoked by the failure of individuals and societies to grow while maintaining their identities in the face of change. And while the novel is steeped in Achebe’s native Igbo culture and alert to the conflicts inherent in the historical moment it depicts, its action seems to unfold on a universal stage; it is as rich in human substance as Greek tragedy, and just as mysteriously powerful in its effect.",

For it is precisely J. R. Ackerley’s frank, unashamed, and often hilarious discussions of his beloved Alsatian’s bodily functions, her insistent animality, which bring this particular dog to such vivid and unforgettable life.",

        "text": "To say that Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a book that captured the zeitgeist of the late 1970s and the 1980s is an understatement. Beginning as a BBC comedy radio series, it would mutate into versions in print, on stage, in comics, and on screens small and big, becoming an international sensation. Published as a novel in 1979, it was an immediate bestseller, and its reach with readers only grew as it was expanded by its author into a “trilogy” of five volumes. Douglas Adams’s insouciant way with the definition of “trilogy” is par for his book’s course through outer space, and an emblem of the book’s appeal: It’s silly—cleverly, brilliantly, gloriously, ingeniously, and at times profoundly silly. Despite its technological trimmings and intergalactic itinerary, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a virtuoso performance on the core instruments of British humor, from Three Men in a Boat to Monty Python. Think P. G. Wodehouse in space, complete with the zany names, and you’ll get the idea.",

And oh, yes—it’s a 500-page novel about rabbits. The novel relates the exploits of a small band of unsure but intrepid rabbits who, under threat from encroaching human development, leave their familiar warren and set out across the English Downs in search of a new home. The characters of the rabbit protagonists are convincingly drawn, and the sweep of the action that carries them through encounters with predators, unfriendly terrain, and bad weather—to say nothing of fear, fatigue, despair, and other dangerous states of body and mind—is irresistible.",

Half of a Yellow Sun established Adichie, who hadn’t been born when the war took place, as one of the most talented young writers of the twenty-first century. She now travels between the United States and Nigeria, and so, one might say, does her work; in both her essays and her fiction, she charts how ordinary lives span continents, carrying their own truths and consequences every measure of the way.",

In their beautiful, haunting, unsparing plays, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides—these, alas, are the only tragedians whose works have weathered the centuries—expose the skeleton of human experience with preternatural vision. Freud was right to look for keys to our nature in the elemental confrontations the plays depict; the legacy of these works seems a gift from the gods, a mysterious clue to the puzzles of our hearts and minds. No summary can convey the elemental forces that animate Aeschylus’s work. Informed by the imaginative richness of the myths and epics that preceded it, the trilogy’s wisdom looms like an awesome natural wonder over the philosophical reasoning that Plato and Aristotle would leave in its wake. The truths The Oresteia tells are as ineluctable as fate, and just as enduring.",

Agee was a twenty-six-year-old journalist who’d published a volume of poems two years earlier; Evans was a thirty-two-year-old photographer. The assignment took them to Hale County, Alabama, where they spent eight weeks with three families of tenant farmers. Fortune chose not to run the article that resulted from Agee’s and Evans’s two-month stay, but in 1941 a more significant record of their collaboration finally saw the light: Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, a landmark volume of photographs and prose that has since been recognized as one of the most remarkable books of the twentieth century.",

It’s like Albee has staged The Bacchae in our living room: We see the violence that simmers beneath the veneer of our lives erupt among familiar furnishings.",

        "text": "Louisa May Alcott grew up in Concord, Massachusetts, the second of four daughters of a noted proponent of Transcendentalism, Bronson Alcott. Ralph Waldo Emerson was a friend of the family, as were Henry David Thoreau and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Despite her transcendentalist pedigree, Louisa May Alcott always kept her feet on the ground, working as a seamstress, a governess, a nurse, and, eventually, an author to contribute to the household income. Her most famous work, Little Women, is drawn from her own family life; it is among the most cherished and popular children’s books of all time. Within its comfortable domestic compass, many readers first discover the import of the largest questions: Who am I, and who do I want to be? From the first line—“‘Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents,’ grumbled Jo, lying on the rug”—Alcott taps a vein of realism and colloquial expression that was ahead of its time and that still retains its attraction. What follows is a tale of life, love, friendship, illness, and coming-of-age, one in which the “little women” prove to have more courage, resourcefulness, and character than the adults who ostensibly hold sway over them.",

The book’s unflinching candor, irreverent comedy, and fierce alertness to difficult issues have made it a subject of controversy and a frequent target for book-banning school boards. But what’s most valuable about it is that Alexie’s novel is controversial in the way life itself is controversial: unsettled, uneasy, of two minds about itself and nevertheless ongoing, devastating one day and comic the next.",

It is constructed from the testimony of dozens of people whose lives were transformed by the disaster: plant workers and first responders and their families; members of the clean-up brigades and service providers who coped with the unprecedented scope and severity of the radiation; former inhabitants of the land within thirty kilometers of the power plant that, after evacuation, would come to be designated as the Zone of Exclusion. The distillation of Svetlana Alexievich’s interviews with Lyudmilla Ignatenko, the wife of a deceased fireman, and the scores of other people represented in the pages that follow—Alexievich gives herself no voice in the book, except in the epilogue—is an intense feat of strange and harrowing eloquence. It’s not writing, exactly, but a kind of expressive listening that is made more resonant by each monologue’s setting within a polyphonic sequence. With an imaginative reach Tolstoy might admire, Alexievich assembles evidence voice by voice in the service not of realism, but of the deeper human realities that both history and realism all too often mask.",

S. Eliot’s estimation, the greatest altitude and the greatest depth of human passion any writer has ever delivered. Our mythic picture of the afterlife, which casts such long shadows on our here and now, owes much to the poet’s magnificent imagining of sin and suffering, penance and hope, love and light. His poem is a repository of legend, romance, politics, learning, and belief no less exquisite for its all-encompassing scope. Don’t miss the sinful wonders of Inferno, then make your own judgment on the pleasures to be found in atonement and salvation. ",

She began with an anecdote he had told her when she was a child, about his fiancée, Rosa, who’d been mistakenly poisoned. As she wrote, she has explained elsewhere, “other characters stepped in,” and the unsent letter grew into the manuscript of her first novel, The House of the Spirits, in which vibrant strands of magic realism heighten the color of a sweeping tapestry of romance, betrayal, revenge, social upheaval, and reconciliation.",

In its depiction of an amateur’s embroilment in unsuspected villainy, its attention to the nefarious predilections of government and business interests, its immersion in the seedy attractions of decadence, and—last but by no means least—its sheer page-turning pleasure, A Coffin for Dimitrios is a perfect example of Ambler’s contributions to the genre that has flourished in his wake.",

        "text": "While the emotional sophistication of his stories can make them seem darker than their child-friendly frames at first suggest, there is no shortage of humor or high spirits in Andersen’s fanciful canon. Only a dozen or so of his more than 150 tales were drawn from existing folktales, in the manner of the Brothers Grimm; the rest came straight from his own imagination, enlivened by the vernacular ease and immediacy that made their telling innovative. Despite their relatively recent invention, Andersen’s best tales—“The Emperor’s New Clothes,” “The Princess and the Pea,” “The Snow Queen,” “The Nightingale,” and “Thumbelina,” to mention a few—have taken such strong root in our collective imagination that many readers fail to recognize that they have an author. Famously insecure in life, Andersen would almost certainly be stung by this failure to recognize his genius; but what better tribute to his stories than the assumption that they’re as old as time?",

These books—written over a span of thirty years—cover only half of the author’s remarkable life. In fact, the last volume ends with her just beginning to write the first.",

Around 1990, the job of escorting her to a speaking engagement deep in the Delta of the state.  Stunned that I had been chosen to do this and thrilled that I was going to be with her and hear her live, I counted the hours for this event.  Then, I received a copy of the three-single-spaced list of her “requirements.”    I had had a similar gig for other famous people, none had made such requests.  The one-hour “show” left me breathless but the experience was disappointing, as I learned to deal with the diva mentality behind the scenes.  The experience shaded my experience of hearing and reading her thereafter.  But, on dark days, or troubled times, guess what comes off my shelf to be read for soothing?  I haven’t lived in Arkansas for some 30 years, but her words can reach a base in me like no others.",

Bewitching the king with a nightly dose of suspenseful storytelling, she subverts his custom of killing his consorts at dawn by leaving him yearning to discover what comes next. The stories she unfolds to assuage the violent passions of the king add to our enchantment with her own fate as we pass through the boxes within boxes that make up The Arabian Nights. The best introduction for modern English readers is found in the two volumes of translations made by Husain Haddawy in the 1990s. The first volume, based on a reconstruction by Muhsin Mahdi of the oldest extant text, a fourteenth-century Syrian manuscript, presents an assortment of authentic tales in which magic, love, learning, and mischief fuel adventures both mundane and supernatural for demons and viziers, kings and thieves, maids and merchants. In his second volume, Haddawy offers faithful, fresh versions of the most popular later stories—including those of Sindbad the Sailor, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and Aladdin and the Magic Lamp—that were added to the original constellation of stories as the scope of the Nights grew in later centuries. Each of Haddawy’s volumes provides fodder for a thousand dreams.",

        "text": "He wrote as many as fifty plays; nobody is sure exactly how many, and only eleven survive today. But Aristophanes established some principles of comedy (and even, if truth be told, some jokes) that have survived for more than two-and-a-half millennia. Though the distance of time and topic is of course considerable, there is much familiar in the playwright’s repertoire: biting social satire, ridicule of public figures, wacky physical slapstick, gross-out gags, wordplay, and a message that goes beyond the laughs. Except for that last item, the plays of Aristophanes are more than a bit like Marx Brothers movies. In fact, the best way to appreciate The Clouds may be to imagine the antics of those modern siblings on the ancient stage. The play begins as a story of father and son: Strepsiades (think Groucho), a moderately prosperous country gentleman, is panicking that the young Pheidippides (think Zeppo) has racked up a mountain of debt betting on race horses. Strepsiades has the idea to send his son to the fancy new philosophy academy in Athens to keep him away from the track and, perhaps, to learn some rhetorical tricks that will help outwit their creditors. The son refuses, so the father enrolls himself, and Socrates’s academy turns out to be a madhouse (enter Chico and Harpo). The play ends with a hilarious bonfire of the academy, with Socrates going up in flames. The Clouds, for all the present laughter it can still provoke, is also an artifact of its author’s life and times in the Athenian golden age.",

        "text": "Student of Plato, tutor of Alexander the Great, founder of the Athenian Lyceum, Aristotle possessed a pedigree every bit as singular as his influence would prove to be. His ideas, instruments of investigation, and observations of nature both loom over and underlie much intellectual endeavor. His works had profound authority for medieval thinkers from Muslim mathematicians to Catholic scholastics such as Thomas Aquinas. To be honest, it’s not much fun to turn his pages. Whereras Plato is a pleasure to read, Aristotle is a chore. This is in large part because most of the texts that have come down to us are in fact Aristotle’s notes for the lectures he delivered in the Lyceum. Still, it’s well worth encountering Aristotle’s thinking at its source, and the best place is the Nicomachean Ethics, in which he asks what makes people happy and offers instruction on living a successful life. You might even go directly to books 2 through 5 in order to concentrate on the Aristotelian idea of the behavioral golden mean—the need to conduct oneself between extremes—and the philosopher’s annotated catalog of the necessary moral virtues—courage, temperance, generosity, magnanimity, gentleness, friendliness, truthfulness, charm—and how best to measure them in our own behavior.",

Slender in size and humorous in tone, Old Herbaceous is at root a social novel, reflecting the changes, challenges, and eccentricities of English country life from the late Victorian era to the age of the world wars.",

And although he would bow to fan pressure and resume the franchise nearly thirty years after publishing its initial installments, the seminal impact of Asimov’s imaginative enterprise relies on the original three books composed in the 1940s and early 1950s: Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. First published in bits and pieces in John W. Campbell’s Astounding magazine, the premier showcase of its era, the Foundation stories chronicled “the decline and fall of Rome, writ large,” using Edward Gibbon’s classic books on that subject as a template, as Asimov himself confessed. But the interstellar scope and temporal span of this history of the future, the intense melancholy engendered for the failure of an era yet unborn, the quiet heroism and intellectual byplay, the elements of mystery and detection—all of these components unite to create a sense that the writer (and the reader) is not anticipating things to come. Instead, we look back with providential omniscience from a vantage point even further forward in the stream of time.",

Humanity spreads throughout the galaxy (there are, notably, no aliens to contend with) and reaches a developmental peak after 12,000 years, typified by the uber-civilized steel-clad planet Trantor. Yet one man, Hari Seldon, foresees collapse, thanks to his immersion in the science of “psychohistory,” and sets up a secret long-range buffer—the “Second Foundation”—against permanent downfall. The Dark Ages duly arrive, but the dead Seldon’s proleptic plans are bent by the unpredictable appearance of a rogue mutant who seeks to undo all of the psychohistorian’s safeguards. ",

The ensuing sadness shadows Athill’s emerging career at the BBC and in the book world—she was one of the founding members of the distinguished publishing firm André Deutsch—until she learns, through the wisdom of work and words, to conjure something like happiness from the vagaries of love and the verities of time.",

In Cat’s Eye, the voice belongs to Elaine Risley, a painter who has come back to her native Toronto for a retrospective exhibition of her art. On that return from a self-imposed and apparently necessary exile, she is tempted—with the inevitability that makes all real temptation worthy of the name—to unlayer her past: lost time, lost friends, lost luck, lost meaning. Elaine’s recollections of her teenaged friendship with Cordelia are imbued with longing and an ominous undertone of elegy, for it is their relationship that introduces Elaine to the confusions of loyalty and love, the effects of cruelty and betrayal, and the contradictory repercussions of liberty. Atwood is just as sensitive insinuating all the aches of adulthood and the pains of love, the fleeting truths of creativity and the hard consequences of big ambitions not quite big enough.",

He is also one of the liveliest, most colorful, and most likable presences in all of English literature. Hopeless with his tangled finances, incorrigibly convivial, interested in everything and everyone, Aubrey led a rackety life as an “antiquary,” which might be defined as a cross between historian, archaeologist, and gossip columnist. The Lives, like his other writings, were composed haphazardly: Hodgepodges of picturesque anecdote and deftly concise portraiture, they were “tumultuarily stitched up” by Aubrey for the benefit of a fellow scholar. For centuries, the chaos of Aubrey’s papers awaited an inspired editor. He finally arrived in 1949: Oliver Lawson Dick selected, or, more accurately, assembled, 134 Lives, and introduced them along with a superb ninety-page essay on Aubrey’s own life and times. The result was published as Aubrey’s Brief Lives, and it opened both a new window on the past and a perspective on human nature nonetheless fresh for being timeless.",

        "text": "Of all the saints of the early Christian church, Saint Augustine of Hippo possesses, for the modern reader at least, the most interesting mind. His ideas on language, time, and the mysteries of personality, humanity, and divinity are still provocative—after sixteen centuries!—and his genius for expression remains vivid, even startling. On time, for example, Augustine wrote, “What is time? If nobody’s asking me, I know. If I try to explain it to somebody who asks me, I don’t know.” And it’s unlikely there has ever been a more telling embodiment of the desires that drive us to distraction from the straight and narrow than his youthful prayer: “Give me chastity and self-restraint, but don’t do it just yet.” The Confessions, in its pulsing orchestration of metaphysical chords and personal melodies, is both a religious meditation and a cracking good read. At once an autobiography and a work of biblical exegesis, a philosophical text and a guide to living, it remains one of the most influential books ever published.",

He was well trained for the role, having been handpicked by Hadrian at the age of eight to succeed that imperial luminary. The beneficiary of the finest education the ancient world could offer, Aurelius was drawn to the study of moral philosophy, and his every move as a man of action seems to have been judged according to its lights, as his Meditations attest. Talking to himself in these pages, he has spoken to countless generations across the centuries, showing that retreat into the contemplative chambers of the self can stimulate a brave passage to a truer life, available to us all no matter what our station: “Anywhere you can lead your life, you can lead a good one.”",

She finds herself intimidated by everyone there, except her kind cousin Edmund; constantly bursting into tears, she won’t even take part in her coevals’ racy amateur theatricals. Despite the fact that Fanny can be priggish, by following her convictions she ultimately finds true love. Mansfield Park stands at a distance from Austen’s other novels: Although less lustrous than Emma or Sense and Sensibility, and less vibrant than Pride and Prejudice, it’s probably her most substantial book. While some of her fans find it hard to love, it was actually the author’s favorite.",

It is a parody of Gothic fiction—a wildly popular genre in Austen’s day, and one with which Catherine Morland, the novel’s teenage protagonist, is unhealthily obsessed. She can hardly contain her excitement when Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor invite her to stay at the titular home. For Catherine, an “abbey” must have been the site of all sorts of Gothic excesses; she even fools herself into thinking that Henry’s father, the General, has killed his wife. Soon Gothic fantasies give way to actual struggles, and Catherine learns that real life is not a fiction.",

Pride and Prejudice is a marvel of vivid dialogue, winning characters, and lavish settings, but it is by no means frivolous. Austen’s droll observation of the manners and mores of her characters and their society is throughout inscribed with a stately eloquence and poise. To make art out of universally acknowledged truths and the compromises of social convention, both petty and pretty, is a rare gift, and no writer displays it more consistently than Jane Austen.",

This is Austen’s most social novel, and in both town and country, she depicts a privileged class rife with vulgarity and vindictiveness, where falsehoods can go undetected or might as easily be rewarded. For the upstanding women of Sense and Sensibility, society can be a treacherous place, demanding the engagement of both head and heart.",

        "text": "Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s ill-fated 1912 Antarctic expedition is one of the great adventure stories of all time, and the mythic resonance of its misfortunes seems to deepen with each passing decade. In her novel The Birthday Boys, Beryl Bainbridge envisions the unfolding tragedy through the eyes of Captain Scott and the four men who died alongside him. The “boys” of the title are Scott and his polar companions, each of whom the author allows to recount a stage of the expedition. Through these evocative first-person narratives, Bainbridge memorably captures the humanity of the explorers. Amid the beauty and terror of their surroundings, and under cruel and incredible sufferings, their admiration, affection, and their love for one another become the most remarkable revelations of this gripping tale. The author illuminates the power of male bonding as tellingly as any novelist ever has.",

        "text": "In 1979, New York Times reporter and commentator Russell Baker won the Pulitzer Prize for his “Observer” column; three years later he won another for this autobiographical book. As the title suggests, Growing Up focuses on his childhood, Depression-era years spent in Virginia, New Jersey, and Baltimore under the watchful influence of his mother (his alcoholic father died when Baker was five). Lucy Elizabeth was “a formidable woman. Determined to speak her mind, determined to have her way, determined to bend those who opposed her.” As much as this is a book about the author growing up, it is also a book about Lucy growing old, and the son frames the bulk of the chapters— vibrantly drawn, good-humored scenes of hard times, adventures with the extended family of aunts and uncles, boyhood and adolescent antics, and eventual graduation to college and the military—with affecting portrayals of his aged mother adrift in senility. In his apprenticeship as a newspaper reporter, Baker learned how to find a story and tell it; in his heyday as a satirist, he perfected the ability to illuminate the private and public vanities of the tumultuous times in which he lived; as a memoirist, he added a new dimension to his already considerable skill set. It’s best called wisdom, and it makes this generous remembrance of things past a delight from start to finish.",

That he wrote specifically of his time and place—America in the middle of the twentieth century—and engaged its most dangerous themes—race, Civil Rights, the persisting degradations of history—does not limit the reach of his sentences into the past and the future: They are, and will remain, acute inquiries into the moral and political quandaries of our being, regardless of the age in which they’re read. His essays especially are provocative exercises for the reader; they move with restlessness and agility and, now as then, they offer his readers not solace but a kind of education in sorrow, teaching us that morality is far more fatal, and perhaps more unforgiving, than our sentimental narratives of reconciliation and redemption allow us to believe.

First I hope we're further along than to have any doubts about what he had to say, he seemed to do very important work for a much earlier stage of awareness.  I'm sure the first book about the dangers of polluting rivers was super important at the moment but wouldn't teach us anything now.  Also the language seems from a time black authors saw value in emulating crazy-scholarly white speak in order to be taken seriously.  The problems with this are first of all that it's demeaning for any author to have to hide, authors like Kiese Laymon are so much more powerful now as themselves.  But also it's just achingly overdone and wordy and boring.  In Words of a Native Son Baldwin states the difference between writing a book and a play are that speeches don't work in plays and to write a play he has to cut cut cut and use one word instead of many.  Um you're half right, but that's not a difference, the same thing needed to be done to the essays as well.",

Exploring its deep roots and intricate branches, Ball illuminates the subject with an uncommon blend of intelligence, empathy, and prodigious research; still, it is his personal perspective—shared, ultimately, with descendants of the Ball slaves—that gives his tale its startling inspiration and reverberating power.",

Soon they encounter a piratical band—the leader, Strangman, has a flock of pet crocodiles—and what follows is a Conradian excursion into an increasingly desperate landscape (narratively speaking, The Drowned World is a missing link between Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now). The Drowned World reaches into the future and the past at the same time, portraying an invented world that is both fantastic and strangely literal in its marshaling of detail.",

        "text": "Lost Illusions is a massive novel—more than six hundred pages. Written in three parts between 1837 and 1843, its several story lines conspire to display most of the author’s abiding concerns: the claustrophobic dullness of provincial society and the ruthless snobbery of its Parisian counterpart; the wounds inflicted by every class distinction; the corruption of love and art by money and intrigue; the tawdry expediencies of the literary world; the cynicism of the press; the energies of commerce and industry; youth’s endless capacity for delusion. Balzac no doubt poured his own youthful disenchantments into Lost Illusions. But he filters these disappointments through an intelligence so alert to every nuance of physical, social, and commercial experience that his novel exudes a loyalty to life that no amount of disillusion can diminish.",

What distinguishes this tale in the fullness of its telling, however, is the way in which Balzac uses Goriot’s sad circumstances to paint a dynamic portrait of a society so entangled with venal motives that even the most fundamental human emotions are perverted. The novelist ironically traces Goriot’s descent from prosperity to poverty by sending him ever higher in Madame Vauquer’s boarding house. In the end, our sympathy for old Goriot is mitigated by our awareness that he has been complicit in his own misery, ruined by the monomania that twists his parental affection into a desperate avarice. Like the fatal flaw of many of Balzac’s memorable protagonists, his obsession is neither unimaginable nor obscure, and all the more terrible for its familiarity.",

Along the way, however, he is distracted by the allure of an antique shop. The owner of this old curiosity shop shows Raphael an unimagined treasure: a piece of shagreen (untanned leather) with the power of granting its owner’s every craving. And yet, as the shopkeeper warns his young customer, each wish granted will shrink the shagreen and diminish the days of its possessor. But Raphael is reckless: “I want to live to excess!” he exclaims as he grasps the skin. Thus the scene is set for one of Balzac’s most telling philosophical explorations. In the foreground is the realism of the author’s vivid descriptions of gambling den and curio shop (and subsequent episodes of equally astute observation). In the background is the overriding riddle posed by the supernatural skin and the reflections of the antiquary who proffers it: Do our desires use us up? Moving backward and forward in time, Balzac follows Raphael’s fate through a dynamic panorama of contemporary society, illuminating, through the compulsions of a deliciously melodramatic plot, the metaphysical conundrums that thwart and thrill our souls.",

In the case of The Sweet Hereafter, the terrible calamity is a school bus accident in an upstate New York town; the mundane reality is that the town’s life must go on after its children have been killed in the crash. Providing different perspectives on events, overlapping stories told by four different people portray how each narrator must process grief, and struggle for meaning, in his or her own way. Banks’s novel allows us to see into the heart of a community that is speechless with sorrow. With the same magnanimity through which he imparts the lessons of calamity, Banks imparts the lessons of community as well.",

        "text": "Illness is usually a private matter; a diary, too. But The Journal of a Disappointed Man, a wrenching but deeply humane diary by a young Edwardian suffering from a terminal condition, places the most private ordeal in public view—with extraordinary consequences. For anyone who has ever suffered, or seen a loved one suffer, Bruce Frederick Cummings—who, two years before his death, published his diaries under the pseudonym W. N. P. Barbellion—offers a candid but ultimately uplifting portrayal of the ravages of disease and the larger mysteries of mortality. In its unsparing recapitulation of a life cut short, his diary stands as one of literature’s great monuments to endurance in the face of adversity; it is also, as Noel Perrin calls it, “one of the great affirmations in our literature.”",

Other family sadnesses followed, and to escape their shadow, he decided to spend a season at Golden Gate Fields, a thoroughbred racetrack outside San Francisco. Barich’s attentive, anecdotal account of track life is keenly observed and placed in intriguingly wider contexts by his off-track learning; you’ll discover a good deal in these pages about the city of Florence and its Renaissance culture, for instance, and the author is ingenious enough to place his reading in conversation with the racing life around him. It is the kind of book that, once you’ve finished it, will make you long to be asked, “Read anything good lately?” You don’t need to love horse racing to fall in love with this book.",

For this very public refusal to fight he might have been court-martialed, but was instead sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital, in Scotland, to be treated for “shell shock.”   His months there have been recounted in autobiographical works by at least three men: Sassoon himself (Sherston’s Progress, 1936), fellow poet Robert Graves (Good-bye to All That, 1929), and Sassoon’s doctor at Craiglockhart, noted psychiatrist and anthropologist W. H. R. Rivers (Conflict and Dream, 1923). They have also, more recently, been brilliantly imagined by Pat Barker in her award-winning Regeneration Trilogy.  In these meticulously researched novels, as in life, Sassoon is surrounded by genuine shell shock victims—men who have variously lost the ability to sleep, eat, or speak. The trilogy’s central figure, Dr. Rivers, has the increasingly troubling job of “fixing” these men so they can be sent back to the trenches for more of the infernal combat that broke them. If not mightier than the savage sword that inflicted the wounds of World War I, the pen, in Barker’s hand, bears powerful witness to the scars it left behind.",

The intricacy of the composition comes from Julian Barnes’s playful orchestration of a variety of styles, combining fiction with literary criticism, biography, diversions scholarly and reflective, a chronology, even a mock exam; the charm comes from the unfailing tunefulness of his sentences—they are shaped with a confidence, clarity, and concentrated energy that give great pleasure. With digressive progress, Barnes leads us on a delightfully comic pursuit of large questions: Is love, like art, finally unknowable, except in the imaginative experience of it? Is memory itself an art, in which we shape, in story, our subjectivity? Filled with literary fun of a very high order, Flaubert’s Parrot is a seriously delicious confection. ",

For all its fantasy and adventure, the book is very much written from an adult perspective: It is, in a way, a long meditation on the inevitability of leaving the magical precincts of childhood. Uniquely targeted, with perfect aim, at both kids and adults, Barrie’s masterpiece is the perfect vehicle to introduce a family to the pleasures of reading long tales aloud, for it allows each audience to lose itself in its own transporting reverie.",

Set in the late 1600s, Barth’s Sot-Weed Factor chronicles Ebenezer’s picaresque exploits as he voyages to America to supervise his father’s tobacco business and to immortalize, in epic verse, the destiny of Maryland. The marvelously involved plot leads the awkward young innocent through uncounted attempts by innumerable rogues to divest him of his wits, his fortune, and his virginity. Barth’s virtuosity in detailing these treacherous adventures animates every page of this huge tale with such rollicking delight that, despite its length, one is very sorry to reach its end.",

Just as Bashō elevated the customarily lighthearted haiku into a supple and profound poetic form despite the strictness of its seventeen-syllable constraints, so he transfigured the casual record of a journey into an embodiment of contemplative expression and cultural sensibility, combining both prose and poetry in a single narrative. Spare, contemplative, evocative, and richer than its economy of scale suggests, Bashō’s Narrow Road collects in one exquisite work the ephemeral sights of a samurai-era traveler, the mystical visions of a Zen devotee, and the timeless intuitions of a poetic luminary.",

Infused with the riches of intellectual clarity and moral\nacuity displayed in Johnson’s writing, Bate’s 1977 book is unexpectedly moving, a tale of genius, consolation, and wisdom that will shore up a reader’s defenses against the sorrows and surprises of life.

On account of its descriptions of “unnatural” sex, its fiendish insistence on the connection between sexuality and death, and its vivid portraits of urban seediness, The Flowers of Evil led to Baudelaire’s prosecution for public indecency upon its original publication in 1857. Six poems were banned, and Baudelaire was fined three hundred francs. If the shudder came from the poet’s caress of corruption, drunkenness, and melancholy, the lasting thrill came from his unabashed conviction that the dignity of art and even beauty fell outside the borders of morality.",

Vacuum Diagrams, a collection of connected stories, is part of Baxter’s Xeelee sequence, which encompasses events from the birth of the universe to its destruction twenty billion years later. Baxter’s style is direct, precise, and sparse, capturing the physicality of cosmic reality with both crispness and poetry. He compresses more thought and action into most of his short tales than other writers can squeeze into entire novels, and his tragic sense of life is both mysterious and inspiriting.",

When she told him that she was about to embark upon a memoir of her childhood, he suggested she consider how being a woman had shaped her upbringing and engagement with the world. After some resistance, she took his advice; more than a year and a half of research and reflection—and some eight hundred pages of prose—later, The Second Sex was completed. Its publication in 1949 sent waves of influence through subsequent decades as its arguments and insights disrupted, redirected, and recalibrated conventional thinking about the lives of women. Both formative and transformative, Beauvoir’s scrutiny of the physical, social, and existential experience of women in the West is a groundbreaking work of feminism—and humanism, too.",

        "text": "“The ability to pass over in silence events which I felt so keenly is one of the things which strike me most when I remember my childhood,” writes Beauvoir early in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter; the length and density of her four volumes of autobiography make it clear that this youthful ability is one she would later abandon with a vengeance. Her affections and friendships, uncertainties and confidences, infatuations and intense attachments to ideas as well as people—including her nascent relationship with her brilliant fellow student Sartre—are lushly remembered and related with a decidedly literary complexion. Just as her most famous novel, The Mandarins, a roman à clef of her and Sartre’s postwar circle, is fiction laced with reality, so her autobiography is fact that leverages the ways and means of fiction, a deliberate construction that allows her—with true existentialist agency—to create a portrait of the person she has chosen to be.

In her impassioned book, which spans a thousand years and a variety of nations and cultures, Simone de Beauvoir asserts that all too often the inhabitants of that island are left to their own devices, ignored by the denizens of the mainland, distanced from community by the busy arrogance of youth and separated from it by the misapprehensions of policy and popular thought. As brave as The Second Sex in its confrontation of the fundamental struggles of existence, The Coming of Age illustrates that Beauvoir’s analytical intellect encompasses an intense and enlightening empathy.

        "text": "One might expect a graphic narrative to be lean, wry, linear. Yet the pioneering triumph of Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home is that it’s resonantly rich in thought and theme, nuanced in its framing and feeling, contrapuntal in its treatment of chronology, character, and incident. Bechdel imbues her story with an expressive pulse that moves from words to pictures and back again like an intricate melody passed between the instruments of a string quartet. The memoir is the story of a pre-adolescent girl with two brothers who comes to certain realizations about herself and her family. A labyrinthine web of literary echoes and mythological invocations capture the emerging complexity of her intelligence, and you have to read her images with as much attention as her allusive, probing, and alert prose. More than metaphorically, it’s a handmade book, and lived time is layered into every panel.",

It is one of the signal accomplishments in twentieth-century theater and one of the touchstones of modern literature. It is also, as one contemporary critic said of its two acts, “a play in which nothing happens, twice.” What was revolutionary about Waiting for Godot was its extreme minimalism, from the starkness of its setting to the spareness of its speech. Paradoxically, Beckett’s paring down of existence to just two tramps by a tree has given the play both emotional resonance and enduring relevance. ",

        "text": "Toward the end of his career, Beckett published in English a series of slender volumes, their austere proportions leavened by the stoic comedy that coursed beneath every text he ever set upon a page. The prose of these works—Fizzles, Company, Ill Seen Ill Said, and Worstward Ho among them—reads like writing stripped to a kind of current, a cable unraveled to a single filament that still carries an electric charge: on, off, shock, silence. In Company especially, he’s like a composer who has scraped from his scores all orchestration, all melody, indeed, almost every instrument. He pares his music back to plainchant, a voice in the dark that might find some resonance in what we think and say, and, ultimately, feel: “A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine.”",

By anatomizing thought and syncopating the progress of sentences with obsessive attention, Beckett creates a kind of awkward poise—an anomalous grace—on the stage of narrative. It is both precise and riveting, reveling in the humors and movements of language as it explores, with comic impulse and tragic obstinacy, “the crass tenacity of life and its diligent pains.”",

Needing to recuperate from an illness and in possession of a small annuity, the author gives up her teaching post in “a smoky North of England town” and advertises for a suitable retreat where she might, per her doctor’s prescription, “rest without being too lazy, and laze without being too restive.” Beckwith’s gentle, slightly fictionalized memoir describes—with humor (often hilarity), surprise (sometimes shock), tolerance (at times sorely stretched), affection (genuine and everdeeper), and keen observance—the routines and rituals, traditions and ceremonies of life in Bruach. From her arrival in heavy weather through a cattle sale and a ceilidh (an evening of traditional tunes, tales, and dancing), a funeral and a culminating wedding, Beckwith’s island experience is restorative in every way, peopled with characters as eccentric and endearing as any reader could wish.

The book’s irrepressible hero grows up in a poor Jewish household during the Great Depression. He ventures out from the family circle to find his way in the world, trying his hand at a motley assortment of jobs and encountering a host of colorful schemers, scammers, dreamers, and lovers. Ever restless, always hungering for experience, Augie roams from Chicago to Mexico and on into postwar Europe—“Look at me, going everywhere!” he taunts himself—where he’s wheeling and dealing at story’s end, still searching “for the right thing to do, for a fate good enough.” The worlds through which he passes and the characters he meets are rendered with a richness and a density that is true to life rather than to art; and Augie’s ardent inner life—fueled by the philosophies, plans, and passions he embraces and discards—plays out in pool rooms, department stores, apartment houses, and conversations, just like our own soulful enthusiasms. For six hundred pages, Bellow wrestles Augie’s buoyant encounters with experience into sentences that are extraordinary in their capacity: “They are like hall closets,” Joan Acocella has written, “you open them and everything falls out.”",

Bemelmans’s light-handed drawings and lighthearted verse make this 1939 book and its sequels memorable pleasures, particularly in their original large formats. Wonderful for reading aloud as early—and often—as possible.",

Its heroine is the Queen of England, who one day finds herself, while chasing an errant Corgi, wandering into the mobile library parked outside of Buckingham Palace. After exchanging pleasantries with the librarian and a palace kitchen employee named Norman, she borrows a book by Ivy Compton-Burnett. “She’s not a popular author, ma’am,” says the librarian. “Why, I wonder?” muses the queen. “I made her a dame.” Uncommonly funny, Bennett's little fable offers pleasures no booklover should forego.",

Although written in England, the poem’s action is set in Scandinavia; it centers on the human warrior Beowulf’s courageous encounters with three foes: the beast Grendel, whose fierce attacks have been terrifying the Danes; Grendel’s mother, whom Beowulf battles in an underwater cavern; and, some fifty years on, an unnamed dragon who threatens Beowulf’s homeland in southern Sweden and whom the hero dies defeating. The drama of these battles enlivens the heroic atmosphere the poet conjures: Beowulf’s adventures unfold against a backdrop of stories and loyalties that, together with the monstrous nature of his adversaries, give this tale an ahistorical strangeness and power. Throughout his marvelous rendering, Seamus Heaney captures and holds fast the human feelings that animate this stirring saga.",

Savannah was simply an interesting, and much cheaper, place to hang out. Once there, charmed by the eccentric locals, the journalist in him began to sense something intriguing in a murder trial then in progress (for the second of what would ultimately be four times). Published as “nonfiction,” Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil owes a heavy debt to the imaginative ambitions and techniques of fiction (for instance, Berendt begins his story before the murder happened and writes as if he’d been in Savannah at the time). No matter what’s factual and what’s fudged, it’s all, truly, stranger than fiction, and more entertaining than most truth.",

A carefully observed attempt to take the measure of the doctor’s influence on an impoverished community’s experience, A Fortunate Man is a probing meditation on medicine and meaning, conscience and commitment, and other matters of life and death.",

The composer narrates his tribulations, be they amorous or professional, with unflagging wit and inspiration, and his accounts of performances and travels (in Italy and Germany, in particular) are shot through with the emotional intensity of the Romantic sensibility his music expresses with such power and glory. Imagine a novel by Balzac or Dickens whose protagonist is as great a genius as the author, and you’ll have some idea of the riches of these Memoirs.",

Alfred Bester, certainly the preeminent author of the period, never subsequently reached the heights of his two milestone books, The Demolished Man (1953) and The Stars My Destination (1955). The latter novel in particular, arising from the imagination of a fellow who had been steeped since adolescence in the genre, remains an almost unduplicated example of the ramified intellectual and stylistic summits that science fiction can reach. The first thing that hits the reader about this book is its commanding, jazzy voice—a bravura style which the author clearly relishes, and which his hero as clearly embodies. Bester’s writing is a high-wire act balancing impatient exposition with a sort of baroque improvisation—sentences ricochet across the pages with a thrilling abandon that makes our progress along the taut plot line dizzyingly invigorating.",

        "text": "In the first chapter of the Book of Genesis—in just thirty-one short verses—the world is given form, light is summoned into being, Day and Night are named, Heaven hatched, the stars invoked, and Earth fashioned into land and sea, seeded with plants and populated with creatures. All in less than eight hundred words. That the authority of the language in the most majestic English translation, the King James Version of 1611, seems commensurate with what it describes is astonishing. But what’s it like to read the Bible? Not puzzle over its provenance nor interpret its meaning, not make peace with its traditions nor argue with the inheritances they inform, not evangelize its teachings nor submit to its commandments, but simply read the narratives, poetry, historical chronicles, legends, observances, and revelations it encompasses? In short, reading the Bible is eerie, dramatic, beautiful, equivocal, infuriating, strange, for it is filled with knowledge that is inspired, practical, mystical, and sometimes unintelligible. In its chapters and verses we discover a fathomless universe of character and circumstance rendered in literary modes that are varied and surprising, and often cryptic and oblique. The meanings of what we read in the Bible seem to change their color, if not their substance, depending on the context in which we consider them; this is by no means to say biblical truths are malleable, but rather that life is.",

A vivid depiction of many of the twentieth century’s most telling themes, American Prometheus is a riveting narrative and a moving portrait of an individual of tempered, even tortured, nobility.",

Yet upon her death in 1979, her achievement was still little known outside of literary circles. She produced a concentrated body of verse over the course of her long career, and all of it is collected in this volume. While it’s rather slim as collected works go, it is rich with unassuming splendor. Bishop’s poetry revels in place, and single stanzas can conjure entire geographies. She lived in Brazil for fifteen years (she also translated several volumes of Portuguese literature), and in many of her poems the South American landscape comes into view, as does the Nova Scotian landscape of her early childhood. Her depictions of the world around her are unadorned and exact, alert to mundane and local facts—fish scales, the oil-soaked surfaces of a filling station, a moose in the middle of a road—in a way which suggests that even the smallest realities are infinitely bigger than one might guess.",

Those players, in turn, enjoy the indulgence of teachers and the adulation of the crowd, but soon find themselves lost in the off-field shadows once their youthful season is done; as the Permian coach, Gary Gaines, at one point tells them, “Gentlemen, the hopes and dreams of an entire town are riding on your shoulders. You may never matter again in your life as much as you do right now.” Bissinger carefully balances cultural concerns with human interest in his portrayal of a communal passion that is both seductive and scary; the result is a book that is compelling in every way.

Its emperor is Napoleon and his island is St. Helena, “further away from anywhere than anywhere else in all the world.” In a manner deceptively offhand and in a voice immediately engaging, Julia Blackburn leads us to the fortress-like dot in the middle of the South Atlantic to which Bonaparte was exiled after the Battle of Waterloo. Tracking the last six years of the emperor’s life, Blackburn depicts their peculiar setting and surreal circumstances with thoughtful scrutiny, sorting through the tangle of legend, testimony, and invention that still surrounds Napoleon’s captivity and death.",

        "text": "The remarkable thing about William Blake is that he was a visionary genius twice over—he is one of Britain’s greatest visual artists and one of the greatest poets in the English language. Blake's twofold artistry and unyielding individuality are seen to best effect in his illuminated books, the first of which was Songs of Innocence and of Experience. It is among the most beautiful books ever produced, an unparalleled marriage of word and image. Blake handcrafted the book himself, creating illuminated plates using a singular process that was partly his own invention. The result, as anyone who has seen the originals knows, is breathtaking. Blake created fifty-four illuminated plates for Songs of Innocence and of Experience. Editions containing full-color reproductions are readily available and obviously preferred.",

In an exotic landscape, far across the borders of the manners and mores of their age, these women—lured onward by “glowing horizons of emotion and daring”—imagined unconventional destinies, and for both good and ill, embraced them.

Top of the list is the perplexity Margaret feels—abetted by her grandparents’ unhelpful meddling—over her lack of religious affiliation due to her parents’ interfaith marriage; following close behind are the mysteries of menstruation, the awkwardness of buying her first bra, fear of not fitting in with her new classmates, and envy of more popular and more well-developed friends. Teaching kids to recognize the value of their inner voice when all the outer ones are shouting more loudly is no small gift, which explains in part why Blume’s book is so beloved. Its influence on the minds of readers may be as deep as that of any book published in its era, and the many shelves of diary fiction that are produced each year are a tribute to its lasting influence on our collective imagination.",

The fiftieth voice, belonging to Ronald Blythe, himself born and raised in these East Anglian precincts, links the narratives with sensitive intelligence. While the names of village and villagers have been changed, the honest and evocative monologues ring with authenticity. The collective testimony, captured in the mid-1960s, paints a vivid picture of a community in which the vast changes of the twentieth century are met by deep continuities of history, tradition, and nature. The chorus of voices lingers in the mind long after one has finished reading. Indeed, Akenfield, in the sum of its unassuming parts, transcends its disguise as a reportorial study to reveal a great poetic drama shaped with character and care.",

Fleeing their native city to escape the ravages of the Black Death (the bubonic plague that claimed the lives of more than half of Florence’s denizens in the middle of the fourteenth century), Boccaccio’s elegant evacuees have retreated to a villa in the countryside. Having taken their bodies out of harm’s way, they devote their minds to a round-robin of story, telling one tale apiece on each of ten nights devoted to diversion. Many of the narratives in The Decameron are famously, and scandalously, ribald, and all the more life-affirming for their avowal of the pleasures of the flesh. The vitality of Boccaccio's writing exhibits for the first time in prose, really, the literary vigor of the Italian vernacular, roughly three decades after Dante had done the same in poetry by eschewing Latin in the composition of The Divine Comedy.",

It’s five books in one, really, and each of those contains multitudes in itself. 2666, his last and greatest book, is too slippery to capture. This labyrinthine work of fiction, one of the first great novels of the new century, simply has to be read: Inspiring itself (and the reader) as it goes along, it explodes the idea of the novel as a careful construction to create a work of impulsive energy and expressionism.",

Like poetry, the prayers this book contains describe a space in which thoughts can congregate and gather strength, a stillness that even non-believers can visit time and again to refresh their spirits amidst an eloquence filled with both humility and grandeur.",

It begins in prose (as it will close), introducing the legend of the pious man from the land of Uz and revealing what Job himself never knows: that the miseries visited upon him result from a bet between God and the Accusing Angel (whom we might as well call Satan), who is sure Job’s piety is a consequence of the blessings bestowed upon him rather than true love of the Lord. What would happen if those blessings disappeared? You can read the Book of Job in countless translations, but through Stephen Mitchell’s particular eloquence (abetted by his insightful introductory essay) the reader is powerfully reminded that the tale is prayer as well as story; its words are infused with the searching, impulsive expressiveness of need. In no other writing save the Greek tragedies is the sheer challenge of human existence (to say nothing of the dark majesty of divinity) so boldly assayed.",

His “implacable memory” makes life literally unforgettable. That’s also the word for Borges’s intricate, erudite, playfully dream-weaving work. ",

Non introduco quest'aggettivo per un'abitudine retorica; dico che non è illogico pensare che il mondo sia infinito. Chi lo giudica limitato, suppone che in qualche luogo remoto i corridoi e le scale e gli esagoni possano inconcepibilmente cessare; ciò che è assurdo. Chi lo immagina senza limiti, dimentica che è limitato il numero possibile dei libri. Io m'arrischio a insinuare questa soluzione: La Biblioteca è illimitata e periodica. Se un eterno viaggiatore la traversasse in una direzione qualsiasi, constaterebbe alla fine dei secoli che gli stessi volumi si ripetono nello stesso disordine (che, ripetuto, sarebbe un ordine: l'Ordine).

        "text": "Samuel Johnson’s celebrated Lives of the Poets led James Boswell to acknowledge at the outset that “To write the Life of him who excelled all mankind in writing the lives of others [. . .] may be reckoned in me a presumptuous task.” A hard-drinking ne’er-do-well, Boswell ended up taking seven years to accomplish it. Having met Johnson in 1763, he focused his biography on his subject’s life from that point on. Thus Johnson’s first fifty-three years take up less than one-fifth of Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson (1791), whereas the rest is animated with Boswell’s day-to-day proximity to the esteemed man, producing a sociability rare in lives of the great. The narrative is further enlivened by the contrast between the two men: Their differences in age, temperament, politics, and religion might have ended their relationship if they hadn’t been so congenial in other respects—especially in their mutual appetite for conversation. Thanks to Boswell’s service as an early oral historian, Johnson’s incomparable talk fills the Life’s thousand-plus pages; just as he commanded the attention of his contemporaries, so Johnson still commands ours, speaking to us “in a clear and forcible manner,” as Boswell writes, “so that knowledge, which we often see to be no better than lumber in men of dull understanding, was, in him, true, evident, and actual wisdom.”",

The sentences follow one another like facts in a natural history of sensibility. Bowen’s prose is precise, but it sets off vibrations like the strings of a viola; the resulting music is seductive, compelling, often haunted by the evocation of unresolved, and unresolvable, emotions. If you’ve ever been bewildered by the deliciously tortured delicacy of consciousness that defines the later novels of Henry James and wondered what he is trying to get at, you might read Elizabeth Bowen to find out.

Traveling in the Sahara with a friend, hoping the journey will impart some emotional momentum to their inert relationship, the Moresbys fall further and further away from each other, both losing themselves in a kind of primal surrender. The extremes of detachment and mortification Bowles’s characters pursue and endure give their story the horrific beauty and otherness that other eras might have found in the lives of the saints. His unsaintly couple, neither holy nor blessed, lead our thoughts toward first and last things with an eerie surety. ",

        "text": "Guy Montag is a fireman. But, in the dystopian future of Ray Bradbury’s 1953 classic, a fireman’s duty is not to put out fires, but to start them. His job, in fact, is to burn books, a task that requires the temperature of 451° Fahrenheit. It’s natural to see Fahrenheit 451 as an allegory about censorship, but that would be to limit Bradbury’s purpose and accomplishment. What the tale really celebrates are the freedoms reading fosters—freedoms of thought, emotion, individuality, engagement with others and with nature—which are under threat from mass media, homogenization of public discourse, and the mediated experience technology promotes. But its function as a parable is only made possible by its power as a story: From first page to last, through Montag’s personal perils and larger societal upheavals, the reader follows Bradbury’s fireman on a journey that evokes more questions than it answers—one that is thrilling, satisfying, and deeply haunting.

        "text": "The Chaneysville Incident had its imaginative genesis in the uncovering of the graves of a band of runaway slaves in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, where novelist David Bradley was born. According to legend, they killed themselves rather than be recaptured and returned to slavery. Their legacy animates both the contemporary and historical aspects of Bradley’s gripping novel, which weaves several threads of experience into a fictional fabric that is vivid and furious—both emotionally draining and emotionally satisfying. “A contemporary novel enriched by historic and mythic appointments, and finally made tragic by them,” wrote a reviewer when the book first appeared. Like most tragic works, The Chaneysville Incident bears witness to horrible sins as it testifies that humankind must suffer into truth; like only a few, it’s a terrifically good read.",

Bradley's novel spans worlds 100 years apart with mystery, clarity and love. The opening sentence diagramming a telephone call through the wires is as imaginative as any novel beginning I've read, and a later scene of imagining rides on tractor trailers humming in the distance down the Pennsylvania Turnpike at night from the protagonist's bed fairly breaks your heart. A novel that explores a historical incident along The Underground Railroad, entwines it with modern day corruption, and a fatal ending, I reread Bradley's \"The Chaneysville Incident\" every winter.",

As readers will soon gather, Stroganoff and his dancers are remarkable largely for their off-stage antics and their unbridled eccentricities. Lovers of ballet will find the work of Brahms and Simon doubly delightful; the former was a dance critic in the London press, the latter a journalist who was also a master bridge player (which taught him, evidently, exactly when to hold and when to play his jokes). Yet there is more than enough wit, hilarity, and abandon to bring great pleasure to any reader, even a confirmed balletophobe. While A Bullet in the Ballet is a murder mystery replete with corpses, suspects, interrogations, and revelations, suspense plays second fiddle to the decidedly screwball melody. This reader would have it no other way.",

As a history of that cause, it is both meticulous and majestic in its attention to the strategy and tactics—as well as the suffering and bravery—of a generation of civil rights advocates as it battled brutal proponents of bigotry and the entrenched cowardice and cruelty of local and national institutions. As a portrait of the United States in the tumultuous era from 1954 through 1968, it has few if any rivals in its scope, significance, and emotional force. The first in the trilogy, Parting the Waters details, among myriad other events, the arrest of Rosa Parks and the launch of the Montgomery bus boycott, which King was drafted to lead; the lunch counter sit-ins and the bloody Freedom Rides; King’s unswerving commitment to nonviolence and his imprisonment during a demonstration in Birmingham; his “I Have a Dream” speech at the 1963 March on Washington; and the KKK’s bombing of Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church, killing four young girls.

Despite the assumptions of many planners, architects, and builders, he continues, time means more to most architecture than space; as a corollary, then, it’s clear that design is not as important as the way that design adapts to use as use changes. What starts out as a treatise on architectural adaptability ends up delivering to the reader a host of new inspirations for exploring other “permanent” things—from cities to selves—that are layered in time. How Buildings Learn is a capacious toolbox of ideas, filled with surprising compartments. You’ll learn a lot no matter where you open it.",

The result is a playful, trenchant, inspired, and funny meditation—a philosophical essay in the form of a novel—on the deep meanings we can still find hidden in the dusty folds of a familiar tale.",

        "text": "Composed in aphorisms, anecdotes, and brief topical essays, The Physiology of Taste can be picked up at any time and opened to any page; it is a browser’s delight, best sampled serendipitously. The thirty “meditations” that make up the meat of the book cover a wide range of gustatory subjects, from underlying matters such as taste, the senses, and the pleasures of the table to overriding concerns such as the end of the world, sleep, dreams, death, and digestion. Brillat-Savarin’s appetite is catholic; he tackles turkeys, truffles, chocolate, and coffee with equal gusto. His penchant for theorizing is as French as his fondness for food, and he applies it to subjects as diverse as frying, gourmandism, obesity, and restaurants. Imagine a postprandial conversation, fueled by fine wine and cognac, with a worldly and loquacious uncle whose store of anecdote and eloquence seems endless, and you’ll approach the pleasures that await you in this quirky masterpiece. It is unrivaled to this day as a compendium of food lore, culinary observations, and philosophical ruminations on the art of eating and the art of living. Fortunately, because of the labors and inspirations of M. F. K. Fisher, Anglophone readers lose nothing in translation, for Fisher’s version of Brillat-Savarin’s chef d’oeuvre is not only exquisitely translated, but made immeasurably richer by her amplification of the text in her own notes and glosses. It is guaranteed to bring hours of diversion and delight—and perhaps even a few minutes of the promised transcendence—to any food-loving reader. ",

To attempt to chart the web of relationships of blood, marriage, social strata, economic dependence, love, envy, hatred, and revenge that bind Catherine and Heathcliff to the book’s other characters would make Wuthering Heights sound like a story that somehow got drunk in Victorian England and ended up in the incestuous, jungly psychological precincts of Faulkner’s South. The plot is a tangle of primal feelings as palpable as the untamed landscape and tempestuous weather of the Yorkshire moors that Emily Brontë knew so well. As the couple’s destiny is derailed by prevailing ideas of convention and class, their intense desire drives them to punish each other as passionately as they long to love. Their ardor doesn’t prevail, but it does endure, with a grip on readers’ imaginations that is as baffling, buffeting, and transporting as only the most powerful emotions can be.",

The Da Vinci Code, which dominated the bestseller list between 2003 and 2006, is a case in point. The whole framework is designed to intoxicate nominally skeptical readers with the possibility that history might mean more than it really does, at least for the space of a few hundred pages. The sheer energy of Brown's invention is transporting. It is not that his critics are entirely wrong, but rather that their cavils are beside the point. Sometimes, a page-turner is all you want to get your hands on—holier grails being much too hard to find.",

Published in 1971, Brown’s unprecedented chronicle of the brutal campaigns that destroyed Native American culture and civilization—beginning in 1860 with the wars incited by the relocation of the Navajos and ending with the massacre of two hundred Sioux men, women, and children at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in December 1890—overturned the prevailing mythology of “how the West was won.” It is a disturbing, heartbreaking tale, told with both discipline and moral intensity in Brown’s gripping pages.",

Brown’s mixture of rhyming lines and rhythmic prose follows the fur child as he ventures out to explore the woods about him, returning home at the end of the day to be tucked in and serenaded with a sleepy-time song by his parents. It’s a perfect evocation of the security that children—and, if truth be told, parents—crave.",

The texts are filled with unusual words, and their sentences have the intricate syntax and sonorous cadences one associates with the densest passages of the King James Bible. Yet the reader who persists will soon discover Browne’s unmistakable singularity; his dramatic phrasing gives his observations a strikingly oracular power. Not for everyone, perhaps. But connoisseurs of ornate and erudite prose will relish the astonishing sentences (“The created world is but a small parenthesis in eternity”) that thrive herein.",

        "text": "Some denizens of children’s literature are so entrenched in our collective imagination, and Babar the elephant is certainly one, that they seem natural formations in the landscape of our fancy—timeless, enduring presences the world has always known. Not so, of course; even Babar was invented, making his first appearance in a bedtime tale told one summer evening in 1930 by Cécile de Brunhoff to her sons, five-year-old Laurent and four-year-old Mathieu. When the boys repeated the story to their father, the painter Jean de Brunhoff, he decided to write it down and illustrate it. To appreciate Babar in his full glory, one should seek out editions published in the original large format (with pages measuring approximately 10 ½ x 14 inches) which retain the hand-scripted, cursive lettering for the text (rather than replacing it with roman type). The large scale encourages readers young and old to climb right into Brunhoff’s glorious two-page spreads and have a chat with the gentle beast he animates with simple lines and subtle colors.",

Did Bryson dare? Well, not only did he dare, but so too did his old friend, the roisterous Stephen Katz, beside whom Bryson looked like a buffed triathlete (“[Katz] had always been kind of fleshy, but now he brought to mind Orson Welles after a very bad night”). The pair’s steps and missteps along the AT are hilariously recounted, as is only to be expected from one of our funniest writers. But there’s something more at work here, a quality of heart arising from the fact that there’s somebody else to look out for on these travels (despite Katz’s comically aggravating ineptitudes); it’s the depiction of their friendship that makes A Walk in the Woods the prolific author’s most affecting and satisfying book.",

He’ll climb to ultimate safety only by means of the mysterious thirty-nine steps that give this splendid adventure its title. The first of Buchan’s several Hannay adventures, The Thirty-Nine Steps is a precursor to the spy novel as later practiced by Graham Greene, Eric Ambler, and Ian Fleming; but it is the author’s own storytelling inheritance from the likes of Robert Louis Stevenson and Arthur Conan Doyle that make this book an enduring joy.",

At once a love story, a supernatural adventure, and a vicious satire of the USSR under Stalin, it bursts with a creative energy that propels the narrative forward at lightning speed. Issued in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s, it immediately made its way to the West, where it quickly developed a following. In the decades since, as its black magic and biting humor attract new generations of readers, The Master and Margarita has become an ever more valuable document of the absurdities, dangers, and quandaries of life in the USSR and—all literature being more than local—beyond.",

Written by a Swiss historian who fell under the spell of Italian culture during a tour made when he was nineteen years old, the “essay”—as the author modestly called it—defined a seminal period in the development of the West in a way previously unimagined, and subsequently indispensable. Rather than taking the conventional approach of chronicling strictly political or military history, Burckhardt considered the epic cultural transitions he studied as just that: cultural. By assessing the roles of religion, literature, art, and above all, the rebirth of individualism, along with the shift from superstition to science, Burckhardt fashioned a comprehensive account of perhaps the most influential period in the history of modern civilization. In so doing, he introduced the world not only to the Renaissance, but to the idea of cultural history—in a book that would define the field.",

        "text": "Alex, the frightening narrator of this brutal and brilliant novel, is an amoral, Beethoven-loving gang leader in a near-future\ndystopian Britain.  Whether adolescent girls or a schoolteacher returning from the library, the gang’s victims are treated with an exuberantly vicious disregard: They might as well be faceless, inhuman targets for the random acts of violence, the gratuitous venom of Alex and his thugs (sex, unsurprisingly, is reduced to its mechanical coordinates: “the old in-out-in-out”). The linguistic bravura of the book and the unbound rebellion that is described do not hide for long the philosophical inquiry into good and evil at the core of A Clockwork Orange. Though it’s often compared to 1984 and Brave New World, Anthony Burgess’s book—in part a vision, both prescient and exaggerated, of the coming trauma of youth culture—has an extra layer of surreality and menace. Burgess is more interested in invoking questions than answering them, and he puts his considerable imaginative powers to work in the service of his inquisition. The result for the reader is a vivid tour of an unforgettable future—a journey that remains both intellectually invigorating and deeply unsettling.",

Regardless of one’s political orientation, reading Burke offers the welcome reminder that people are active agents in history, and that amid crisis and upheaval you can’t just philosophize; you also have to act, and act with prudence as well as passion.",

Unloved by her pretty mother, Mary has been raised by servants who’ve done nothing but indulge the child in order to appease her petulance. Orphaned by cholera, she is shipped off to England to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven, an equally ill-tempered person whose slight hunchback symbolizes his cramped heart, embittered by ceaseless mourning for his deceased wife. Soon after arriving on the estate, Mary stumbles upon a walled garden that’s been locked and abandoned since the death of Mrs. Craven. Unbeknownst to anyone, Mr. Craven has buried the key; Mary, guided by a helpful robin (one of the story’s several fairy-tale touches), unearths it and surreptitiously rejuvenates the dormant plot, creating—with the help of her maid Martha and Martha’s resourceful young brother Dickon—an oasis that will not only nurture Mary’s emotional flowering, but restore the health of her invalid cousin and rouse her uncle from his profound grief. Ripe with metaphor and a heartwarming faith in the sympathetic magic of nature and friendship, The Secret Garden is a lovely fable of perseverance, restoration, and redemption. ",

        "text": "Robert Burton was a British scholar who spent virtually all of his adult life at Oxford University, first as a student and then as the librarian of Christ Church College. His vast erudition found expression in one of the most bookish books ever written: The Anatomy of Melancholy. Burton, the sedentary bookman, was melancholic himself, and on one level his Anatomy is a serious, encyclopedic attempt to understand melancholy and the various cures that had been proposed for it at one time or another; it has been called the first detailed psychological work in English. On another level, though, the work is a mischievous escapade—an insanely learned scholarly joke. The comedy derives from Burton’s inexhaustible range of reference (more than 1,300 authors are cited) and his unstoppable loquacity (in his final version, there are more than 500,000 words). Weaving a tapestry of quotation, digression, contradiction, and mindful, ceaseless musing, Burton often reaches a pitch of giddy profundity that is nothing short of hilarious. ",

He was also a market farmer, a family man, a literary critic. Butler’s overriding themes—that the lessons of life and death are both local and moral; that culture withers without a dwelling place; that conduct, like a compass, needs a fixed point to find its way—are put through eloquent variations in these collected essays.

        "text": "Samuel Butler’s The Way of All Flesh, a scorching semi-autobiographical novel, doesn’t ring many bells today; you might struggle to find it in a bookstore (if you could first find a bookstore). Yet, at the dawn of the twentieth century, The Way of All Flesh crashed onto the English literary scene with the impact of a meteor; for the intellectual and artistic vanguard of a generation it stood as a brave, galvanizing indictment of a society the new breed was only too happy to see fading away. Skewering the Anglican church, the bourgeoisie, the universities, and above all the sclerotic Victorian class system, Butler’s novel follows several generations of the Pontifex family: prosperous, middle-class, religious, well-intentioned, and ultimately monstrous. While The Way of All Flesh has largely disappeared from view, its literary influence remains pervasive, from George Orwell, who was quite conscious of his debt to Butler, to any number of contemporary novelists who might not be aware of the roots of the irony in which they couch their tales. More importantly for readers, Butler’s understanding of the perils of pious convention has much to teach our own impious age.",

Despite—or perhaps because of—its surreal stasis, The Tartar Steppe exerts a formidable spell. Buzzati refuses to reduce its force to a simple message, yet the novel suffuses our imaginations with a powerful sense of meaning nonetheless, for in its pages the author has fashioned a ghost story that is haunted by the most unnerving spirits of all: our own expectations.",

Purporting to be a record of conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, in which the inveterate traveler describes the many extraordinary cities he has encountered in his wanderings, it is in fact a fiction of poetic and philosophical charm that unfolds in brief descriptions of fifty-five fantastic places, from Anastasia, “a city with concentric canals watering it and kites flying over it,” to Zenobia, which, “though set on dry terrain . . . stands on high pilings, and the houses are of bamboo and zinc, with many platforms and balconies placed on stilts at various heights.” To read Invisible Cities is to discover an unsuspected mythology whose truths are inexplicably recognizable; it is unlike nearly every other book you will ever open. A true master of the fabulous, Calvino succeeds by making his readers feel they are as imaginative as he is.",

At first the citizens of Oran panic and revolt, but before long, as if numbed by the summer sun, their alarm gives way to despondency and resignation. Bodies are piled high in the streets, neighborhoods stink of pestilential flesh, homes are burned, and citizens wander in a hopeless daze. Yet somehow life goes on. The Plague has the intensity of a medical thriller, but it’s more than that. Through his matter-of-fact narration of this book’s horrifying events and their aftermath, Camus manages to convey the lesson, as hopeful as it is simple, that he believes we are taught, not only by pestilence, but by existence itself, \"that there are more things to admire in men than to despise.\"",

Slightly Out of Focus is Capa’s personal take on World War II in Europe between 1942 and 1945. It is characterized from the outset by his congenial tone—“There was absolutely no reason to get up in the mornings any more,” he begins, detailing a lazy morning in his New York studio—and his storytelling flair. In fleet and vivid prose, complemented by his arresting photographs, Capa recounts his intimate experience of fateful, fearsome events from London to Algiers, Sicily to Normandy. Describing battlefield experiences and reminiscing about people he met in the shadow of war, Capa’s voice—compassionate, moving, and often very funny—proves as expressive as his camera.",

The story of their gruesome end made the New York Times, where it was read by literary light Truman Capote, who determined almost immediately—even before the eventual suspects were arrested—that he would go to Kansas and write the story of the crime. In this groundbreaking work of creative nonfiction, Capote reconstructs the homicides and their aftermath with stunning attention and a paradoxically expressive reticence; from the perpetrators’ first knowledge of the well-to-do farmer, gleaned from a former jail mate, to the discovery of the murder scene and the subsequent investigation, capture, trial, and punishment, In Cold Blood is one of the most powerful true-crime dramas ever penned. It remains the gold standard of the genre it transfigured, and transcends.",

An almanac can fill the bill, or a dictionary (John Ciardi’s A Browser’s Dictionary leaps to mind), or any number of diaries or collections of letters, but few volumes serve such serendipitous purpose as well as John Carey’s delightful compendium, Eyewitness to History. Beginning in 430 BC with a description by Thucydides of the plague in Athens, and concluding with James Fenton’s account of the fall of President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines in 1986, Carey’s addictive anthology delivers nearly two-and-a-half millennia of history in more than three hundred eyewitness reports, most just a few pages long (and nonetheless potent for that).",

        "text": "The son of an Irish convict father, Ned Kelly stole horses as a child, murdered policemen, robbed banks, and took up as a “bushranger”—the Australian term for runaway convicts who evaded British authorities in the open continent. His notoriety grew until Kelly became a Robin Hood–like symbol of Irish-Australian opposition to the young country’s Anglo elite. Today he’s seen as an icon of the Australian psyche—untamed, independent, and a little crazy. A tour de force of authorial invention and tonal control, Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang tells the outlaw’s story in his own voice, with the protagonist frantically scribbling down his story as he flees the police. Working from a long letter Kelly wrote in 1879, Carey invents an entire vocabulary and syntax of Kelly English: muscular, vernacular, and totally profane. Although the unforgettable voice of Kelly, which makes a century-old outlaw’s tale breathtakingly immediate, may be the most memorable achievement of True History of the Kelly Gang, this book is also a rock ’em, sock ’em true crime tale of page-turning intensity.",

        "text": "Every morning, as he walked his children to school through his Paris neighborhood, American transplant Thad Carhart passed a modest storefront that intrigued him. “Desforges Pianos: outillage, fournitures” announced its stenciled sign, and the tools and components of piano repair displayed in its window—tightening wrenches, tuning pins, pieces of felt, small pieces of hardware—illustrated the work that went on behind the glass. Venturing inside on several occasions to express his interest in acquiring a used piano, Carhart was mysteriously rebuffed. The shop seemed as determined in its reserve as the most punctilious Parisian aristocrat. Carhart’s cracking of the code of that reserve—he must, he learns, be recommended to the shop by one of its existing customers—is his first step into the “intricate world of mutual trust and obligation” that is the city’s hidden community, “the complicated network of local relationships that it was extremely difficult for a foreigner to penetrate.” Carhart effortlessly delivers an informative course in the history and construction of pianos and offers more insight into the French temperament than you might discover in a dozen weightier tomes. Best of all, he introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters, including the tuner Jos, who sleeps in empty trains; Carhart’s Hungarian teacher, Anna, who reacquaints the author with the pleasures of Bach and Bartók, Schumann and Schubert; and, most memorably, Luc, the master of the atelier, whose expertise and gift for friendship is portrayed with great affection.",

That’s saying a lot, for Robert Moses was for a good portion of the twentieth century the most powerful man in the economic capital of the world. From the 1930s to the 1970s, he shaped the physical destiny of New York City and its suburbs. He was the greatest builder America has ever known, constructing public works—bridges, dams, beaches, parks, roads, housing—on an unprecedented scale. Without the benefit of elective office, Moses built an empire whose reach and resources were longer and deeper than that of most legislative and governmental bodies, and he ruled it as an autocrat. Caro tells this extraordinary human and political story with a special sensitivity to the ways and means of power, which Moses amassed, wielded, and corrupted in ways both brilliant and brutal.",

But you’ll be surprised to discover that the dimensions of the man—and his “years”—merit both the author’s prodigious labor and a reader’s attention. Each book in the sequence has its own story to tell, with many digressions that illuminate political moments and contemporary issues and personalities; all are constructed in digestible episodes crafted to allow readers to dip easily back into these big books after days, weeks, or even months away. Together, they relate, with unsurpassed fascination, what happens when the American dream becomes entangled with the American realities of class, race, money, business, and influence—and, every once in a while, breaks free.",

Imagine tracing the development of a Shakespearean tragic hero through the formative stages of his life and you might have some idea of the resonating elements Caro finds in his subject’s emerging character.

Kennedy’s vice president; Kennedy’s assassination and the subsequent national trauma; and, with incisive attention, the dramatic—one might aptly call them heroic—first seven weeks of Johnson’s tenure in the White House, in which he showed himself to be a legislative genius, a courageous champion of civil rights, and, by no means least, a leader with enough probity and presence of mind to steer the country out of the crises of grief and government provoked by the assassination of JFK. It’s a book nearly impossible to put down, and so stirring in its depiction of tragedy and triumph that one is compelled to go back to the very beginning—volume 1, that is—to uncover more about the man at the center of it.

Despite—or perhaps because of—its nonsensical pedigree, it has proved to be an addictive pleasure for analysts seduced by its dense mix of childish frivolities, hallucinatory happenings, logical puzzles, and keen adult observations. Carroll’s imagery, phrases, and characters have not only been attached to myriad toys and games, but continue to enliven the language in everything from rock ’n’ roll lyrics to ordinary conversation. Most remarkably, although the Alice books date from the nineteenth century and are as ingrained in our culture as any stories ever told, they remain as fresh as the day they were written, delighting new readers every day of every year.",

Researched and written over four years, it examines the interdependence of species in nature and postulates a world in which chemical pesticides have not only upset that delicate balance, but wiped out entire species as well. Lyrically written, scientifically astute, and passionately argued, Silent Spring informed opinion and changed policy across the nation; it led to a ban on DDT and became a catalyst to the global environmental movement.",

He’ll do absolutely anything—lie, cheat, scrounge, steal—if he thinks it’ll help him paint another painting.

And what a life it was: Ecclesiastic and secretary, soldier and spy, financier, gambler, historian, translator, alchemist, violinist, accomplished seducer, ardent (and surprisingly tender and attentive) lover, and, last but not least, remarkable storyteller, Giacomo Casanova swept through bedrooms, courts, and cities with reckless charm, talking his way, as one commentator put it, “from Paris to Saint Petersburg and back again.” There is a palpable urgency to History of My Life that resembles nothing so much as the perpetual present tense of a movie. Both compelling and entertaining, Casanova’s narrative is alive with action and headlong momentum. Each episode is dramatic, sensual, and pictorial. In sum (four thousand pages) or in part (don’t miss his marvelous account of his escape from the Leads, Venice’s fabled prison, which concludes the fourth volume), these memoirs are a delightfully diverting treasure.",

Casey deftly conjures both the manual work and the metaphorical romance of taking to sea in language that swims easily in both practical and poetic waters, while the weather through which protagonist Dick Pierce must pass on his journey toward self-discovery takes several shapes, confronting him in the form of the tourists taking over the Narragansett shore, the undercurrents of class and money that trail disappointment in their wake, the exhilaration and disruption of infidelity, and—last but not least—the physical terror of a hurricane.",

        "text": "The Book of the Courtier depicts the world of its author, Baldassare Castiglione, a nobleman in the service of the Duke of Urbino, who led the most sophisticated court in Italy in the early sixteenth century. Castiglione’s volume, which he worked on for more than a decade, is a “courtesy book,” a genre of the High Renaissance that propounded etiquette lessons, rules for moral behavior, and advice for nobles in navigating the waters of politics and politesse that always surround royalty. Through a series of dialogues, modeled on the classical precedents of Plato and Cicero, Castiglione argues that a true gentleman needs both military training and education in the humanistic disciplines, such as music and history. Published in Italy in 1528, when publishing was still a young technology, The Book of the Courtier was a smash—it rocketed across the Continent and found an especially eager audience in England, where its principles of good living were especially influential (a translation came out just as Queen Elizabeth I was coming to the throne). The Book of the Courtier is still very much worth reading five centuries on for its unrivaled depiction of the aristocratic virtues and values of the Renaissance, and for its celebration of the kind of worldly grace to which even the humblest among us at times aspire.",

        "text": "In Hanover, Nebraska, a Swedish immigrant dies and leaves his farm not to his sons, but to his daughter. Despite drought, economic depression, and the demands of the land the family inhabits, Alexandra Bergson, one of American literature’s most vivid heroines, is determined to make a success of the farm through ambitious expansion and diligent husbandry. Weathering the challenges posed by her brothers and by her loneliness as a frontierswoman, she navigates practical and emotional complexities by means of an inner compass that, if not unerring, is enduringly true, even when she loses sight of it. The first book in a trilogy of “prairie novels” that includes the equally rewarding The Song of the Lark and My Ántonia, O Pioneers! is the story of a woman who must learn what it means to come into her inheritance, just as it reveals the artistry of a writer who is discovering hers.",

Catullus’s primary subject is love, or more properly, the course of infatuation, negotiation, yearning, pleasure, disaffection, heartache, and despair that is love’s life cycle. Distinctive, acute, clever, and conversational, the voice that animates his best lines rings clear in modern ears.",

        "text": "David Cecil’s biography of the British statesman William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, is reputed to have been John F. Kennedy’s favorite book. If that’s true, the thirty-fifth president had extremely good taste. Melbourne’s role as mentor to Queen Victoria upon her ascension to the throne at the age of eighteen is of considerable historical interest, but his life has a compelling narrative beyond his role as prime minister and early counselor to the young woman who became such an enduring monarch. In fact, Melbourne’s life fell rather neatly into two parts, as reflected in the two halves of Cecil’s work—The Young Melbourne and the Story of His Marriage with Caroline Lamb, published in 1939, and Lord M, or the Later Life of Lord Melbourne, which appeared in 1954. Each half is galvanized by a woman whose presence enriches with drama and character the events of Melbourne’s political career.  Cecil’s sensitivity to Melbourne’s singular progress shapes a book that provides the reading pleasure of the great English novels, for it boasts not only the illuminating alertness of Austen but the expansive intelligence of George Eliot as well.

Burroughs. That nerve—characterized by an energy that is touchy, vitriolic, vicious, mocking, misanthropic, savagely sarcastic, and relentlessly mordant in its intelligence, but shot through with an astonishing eloquence nonetheless—is the voice of Bardamu, the autobiographical novel’s first-person narrator. Céline wrings a thrilling, terrifying music from life’s misery, cruelty, and absurdity. His breathless, savage prose, with its constant use of ellipses and its “hasty, panting tone” (as the author himself characterized it), is one of the seminal inventions of the modern imagination, and the book in which it was born remains shocking and strangely exhilarating today.",

        "text": "Many artists have had tumultuous personal lives, but few have as crazy a story to tell as the Renaissance sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini. He survived prison and plague, befriended popes and princes, had affairs with too many people to count (women and men), made dozens of enemies who were bent on betrayal, and, not to be forgotten, even killed a couple of folks. As an artist, Cellini is best known today for decorative works, and he doesn’t figure in the first rank of Italian sculptors of his time. His spectacularly racy autobiography, on the other hand, has no peers: It’s the most important autobiography of the Italian Renaissance, and it’s as thrilling, as fast paced, and as dangerous as a drag race.",

That Quixote is delusional is beyond argument; that his exploits entertain us is also beyond dispute—the laughter his quests prompt is one of literature’s great joys. Yet Cervantes never mocks his protagonist, but rather portrays his errant knight-errant with a sympathy that bestows upon him an unabashed dignity, steeped in the character’s stubborn desire to make meaning in a way that motivates mind, heart, and soul; that his passions remain heroic despite all the embarrassments of conduct and circumstance they generate is a tribute to Quixote’s yearnings, to the wiles and wisdom of Sancho Panza, and to the sensibility of their creator, who, beleaguered in life, is, in the end, triumphant on the page.",

The titular heroes are Joe Kavalier and Sammy Klayman (who changes his name to Clay), teenage Jewish cousins who share a love of drawing and a fascination with Harry Houdini. As he narrates the cousins’ rise to prominence, Chabon paints a wonderful portrait of the golden age of comics. At the same time, life outside the comics frame intersects with Kavalier and Clay’s fantastic world: There’s the war, the young men’s relationships, Joe’s concern for his family, the burgeoning of pop culture, the role of Jews within that, and even a golem. From Prague to Brooklyn and back again, Chabon’s imagination wraps us in the welcome embrace of a capacious and satisfying story. All of which means one needn’t be a comics aficionado to appreciate Chabon’s surprising, amusing, thought-provoking, language-rich, continent-spanning novel.",

The warmth of Clémentine’s personality emanates from the kitchen to enhance every aspect of the family’s home life, and Chamberlain depicts the spread of her influence with infectious good cheer.

With his stylized prose and flair for similes, he gave his detective Philip Marlowe a voice that would become the hallmark of the genre. Marlowe is the protagonist in all of Chandler’s novels, and the movies drawn from these fictions proved to be a heavy influence on American film noir, just as the books influenced generations of detective novelists.",

Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant? is Chast’s first full-length book project, and it brings her peculiar gifts to bear on a theme particularly suited to them: the end days of her parents and her own shifting reactions to their senescence and mortality. Prompted by the unprecedented intimacy of the material, Chast imbues her graphic memoir with an astonishing honesty and emotional eloquence, extending her idiosyncratic perspective on everyday life to the most dumbfounding subject of all: everyday death.

The latter is a travel book of a peculiar, and peculiarly rewarding, kind: Its landscape is the vast, and largely uninhabited, stretch of Central Australia, yet its landmarks are outcroppings of ideas—presented in pages labeled “From the Notebooks”—that reach from Bedouin proverbs to Baudelaire, Herodotus to Heidegger, all centering on the question of human restlessness.",

Only in the 1390s did Chaucer start to think of his baggy assemblage as a single narrative, conceiving a framing story, called the “General Prologue,” in which the tales’ various narrators are introduced as pilgrims on their way from London to Canterbury Cathedral, which houses the shrine of Saint Thomas à Becket. The pilgrims, a mixed crew of squires and commoners, decide to partake in a story-telling competition, with the winner getting a free meal at a London tavern. Their tales range widely across styles and genres, from romance to sermon to fabliau (a type of bawdy comedy), and even include a scientific treatise. Censored, expurgated, or banned outright for centuries (one American school struck it from the syllabus as recently as the 1990s), The Canterbury Tales retains its power because it’s a rollicking read, full of lavishly beautiful poetry spiced with hilarious comedy.

Radiocarbon dating has established these images to be more than thirty thousand years old; they are the oldest known paintings in the world. With nearly one hundred large color photographs, Dawn of Art is a stunning volume, documenting a thrilling discovery as it provokes both thought and awe. ",

While the nearly seven-hundred-page Stories of John Cheever delivers much more than the sum of its parts, it must also be proclaimed—with pleasure and admiration—that those parts remain more gloriously particular than its author’s enduring reputation as the “Chekhov of suburbia” implies. And although Cheever’s people seldom prove themselves up to the task of redemption, they seldom lose hope of its embrace; like nymphs pursued by insatiable divinities, these recognizable modern Americans survive—and perhaps even triumph—through their transformation by Cheever’s hands into figures of warning, yearning, and human imperfection.",

The gallery of characters he created in his tales includes a wide range of Russian society—peasants and bureaucrats, students and soldiers, lovers and prisoners—and his exploration of stream-of-consciousness brought their inner lives to the page with a revelatory intimacy.",

Deeply humanistic, Chekhov’s four dramatic masterpieces are emblematic of our modern domestic lives in the same way Greek tragedies are emblematic of a more cosmic and radical vision of human agency. Distanced from the gods and their interventions, Chekhov’s characters move through their modest calamities, losing the homes, habits, vocations, and loves that might provide fragile protection against the long loneliness that terrifies us all. The Cherry Orchard (1904), perhaps Chekhov’s most telling achievement, uses the auction of a family estate to contrast the fortunes of the fallen aristocracy with those of the rising bourgeoisie; yet the atmosphere the play creates transcends social and political circumstances to engage both the inexorability of time and the unappeasable misgivings of human nature.",

It’s true that Chekhov’s plays are filled with unhappy people, and if you suffer through a bad production, you might think there is not much more to them than miserable Russians moping on country estates, moaning about failed affairs and thwarted ambitions. Then again, an inept production of Oedipus the King might make Greek tragedy seem like some sick combination of soap opera and horror movie. But just as Aeschylus and Sophocles treat the fundamental and enduring themes of human existence—fate, inheritance, savagery, pride, justice—so Chekhov treats the worries of our daily lives: loneliness, love, financial uncertainty, the persistent pangs of time’s passing. Chekhov wrote more than a dozen plays, but the last four are his most accomplished and most performed, and the quartet—because of their original realization by Konstantin Stanislavski under the auspices of the Moscow Art Theater—are seminal works in theatrical history.",

In each of these works, subtext is as powerful as action: Characters often speak around their emotions, and a seemingly inconsequential line about the weather or plans for the day can have overwhelming emotional force. Deeply humanistic, Chekhov’s four dramatic masterpieces are emblematic of our modern domestic lives in the same way Greek tragedies are emblematic of a more cosmic and radical vision of human agency. Distanced from the gods and their interventions, Chekhov’s characters move through their modest calamities, losing the homes, habits, vocations, and loves that might provide fragile protection against the long loneliness that terrifies us all. In Uncle Vanya (1899–1900), the disappointments of aging and romance rub up against life-affirming moments of passion, learning, and labor.",

Then again, an inept production of Oedipus the King might make Greek tragedy seem like some sick combination of soap opera and horror movie. But just as Aeschylus and Sophocles treat the fundamental and enduring themes of human existence—fate, inheritance, savagery, pride, justice—so Chekhov treats the worries of our daily lives: loneliness, love, financial uncertainty, the persistent pangs of time’s passing. Chekhov wrote more than a dozen plays, but the last four are his most accomplished and most performed, and the quartet—because of their original realization by Konstantin Stanislavski under the auspices of the Moscow Art Theater—are seminal works in theatrical history. Three Sisters (1901) depicts sophisticated Muscovites struggling to adjust to life in the country.",

If Hamilton was not fated to become president, he would, as a consolation prize, become something of a rock star two centuries after his death. “No immigrant in American history has ever made a larger contribution than Alexander Hamilton,” Chernow tells us—and he did it all before his death at forty-seven in a duel with Aaron Burr, our third vice president. He was too protean, too smart, too reckless and charismatic a figure for his full likeness to be caught in a statue, much less on the ten-dollar bill, so one is grateful to Chernow for capturing it in these pages, and for inspiring others to rejuvenate his legacy.

At age twenty-four, “Cherry” (as he was familiarly known) was the youngest member of the expedition. He wasn’t one of the four who went with Scott on the last leg of the actual trip to the South Pole, but Cherry did belong to the team that eventually discovered the bodies of Scott and the others in the frozen wasteland of the “Great Ice Barrier.” Given this book’s dramatic title, it’s no surprise that it has always had readers. Yet its stature has grown in the decades since its original publication, so much so that the critic A. Alvarez would make the following claim for it in the late 1990s: “The Worst Journey in the World is to travel writing what War and Peace is to the novel or Herzen’s Memoirs are to autobiography: the book by which all the rest are measured.” That is just what Cherry-Garrard’s chronicle of polar exploration is: the greatest travel and adventure narrative ever written.",

The purpose was political: to alert an unprepared England to the threat posed by German ambitions. It was by no means the only example of “invasion fiction” created by British writers at the time to stir their sleepy country to naval investment, but it was the most influential in promoting the cause of military readiness, and—more important for later generations of readers—it has proven the most enduring, for the simple reason that it is a rip-roaring good yarn.",

Upon her return home, she embarks upon a series of actions—social and sexual—that lead to fleeting moments of fulfillment and an unfortunate end. Beautifully written, Chopin’s once scorned tale of liberation has become an acknowledged classic in the century since her death. It certainly deserves that status.",

In King’s Abbot, where Hercule Poirot has retired to garden, the suicide of the widowed Mrs. Ferrars is surrounded by rumors that she had killed her husband a year earlier. When well-off Roger Ackroyd, with whom the widow had been dallying, is found murdered in his locked study, Poirot puts down his gardening tools and begins digging into the criminal intrigue. As always in Christie, there is an abundance of suspects, one seeming more likely than the next, as well as clues hidden in plain sight to all but Poirot, whose “little grey cells”—as he invokes his fabled brainpower—allow no assumptions to cloud his ratiocination. The book—and the case—comes to a stunning conclusion in a plot twist so unusual, it would reverberate throughout the golden age of mystery that Christie’s intricately constructed tales heralded.",

But soon, abetted in no small part by President Ronald Reagan’s praise for its page-turning excitement, Clancy’s novel grew into an extraordinary commercial success. Deploying complex knowledge of espionage and military science to both tether the book’s flights of transporting suspense and direct its characters’ passage—via cunning and courage—through rough seas of duty, loyalty, and honor, Clancy created what would prove to be a pioneering work in a new generation of techno-thrillers, paving the way for a legion of bestselling successors from the likes of Stephen Coonts, Vince Flynn, and Dale Brown.",

Her portrait of Rome eternal, and of the Holy City during the Holy Year of 1950 (with ancillary sketches devoted to the career of the Sicilian bandit Salvatore Giuliano and to the haunting magnificence of Hadrian’s Villa), is clearly the distillation of intense personal and intellectual engagement. It surveys the continuous history of emperors and popes, saints and poets, architecture and aesthetics through a sensibility stylishly captured in Clark’s watchful prose. In both gaze and glance she stays alert to the beauty and wisdom about her, whether decorative—no one has written more brilliantly of the exhilaration of Rome’s fountains—or essential: “those freakish squares and the narrow streets around them, most vividly in the old quarters, Trastevere and all the part between the Corso and the Tiber, do not constitute an outside in our sense, but a great rich withinness, an interior. . . . In Rome to go out is to go home.” ",

        "text": "The decade of Childhood’s End’s publication was rife with tales of alien invasions and “first contact,” especially in lowbrow cinema, as films like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Invaders from Mars (1953), and This Island Earth (1955) attest. Clarke’s novel fits neatly into that subgenre, but uses the familiar tropes freshly and with maximum sophistication, yoking them to the then cutting-edge, and soon to be popular, mystical speculations of the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin about the ultimate fate of consciousness. Childhood’s End—like Clarke’s subsequent work, The City and the Stars (and 2001 as well)—exudes a rich and almost gnostic sense of loss at the same time as it conjures the breathtaking possibility of a new, if unfathomable, unfolding of reality. For a thinker who radiated an engineer’s practicality (he forecasted orbital satellites and their uses before any such things existed), Clarke also harbored a poet’s soul, giving him perhaps the perfect apparatus for crafting science fiction that reveled in a melancholy hope, both thrilling and perilous.",

        "text": "“How would you wash an axe if it had traces of blood on it, and you wanted to remove the traces?” In the spring of 1950, Richard Cobb was asked that question by his old schoolmate Edward Ball. One of the leading British historians of the French Revolution, Cobb brings to his memoir the same idiosyncratic focus and flair that animate his scholarly works. Throughout the book, the reader’s fascination is held as much by the author as by his murderous friend; like some amiable but not entirely harmless relation of Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley, he narrates his gruesome tale with a confidence and concentration that is creepily seductive—a reaction, one suspects, that Cobb would relish.",

After losing his job as a civil service gardener, a disfigured man of limited mental capacity leads his impoverished, critically ill mother out of a war-torn city so that she might die in the place where she spent her girlhood, the only happy time in her memory. She dies along the way, and Michael K seeks refuge on a deserted farm in the country; there his life is pared down to essentials as he learns to live off the land. Even in his remote retreat, he cannot evade the nameless war: It sweeps down on him and finally relegates him to a work camp.  Relentlessly bleak, yes. And yet, on the strength of Coetzee’s fierce vision and the declarative lucidity of his prose, extraordinarily life affirming as well.",

Any page of Colette is a vivid translation of experience into a generous language of perception and embrace. The personal quality that animates her writing crosses genres with abandon to give the wide variety of prose she penned—fiction, memoir, essays, reportage—a unity of effect and a power of expression that transcend any individual work. Accordingly, this volume, an “autobiography” artfully drawn from her writings by Robert Phelps, offers the best introduction to her world and a splendid representation of her genius. It is also a great and fascinating joy to read. ",

Be his subject poetry workshops or forgetfulness, saxophones or cows, canceling a vacation or nursing a hangover, Collins shapes his poems with a gentle but incisive humor that is ingratiating, intelligent, and, with delightful regularity, inspired. In his work the immediate genius of a stand-up comic is allied with the slow intelligence—the layering of life, learning, and lyrical intuition—of an accomplished poet, so that the reader is transported over the edge of understanding and, for a moment, suspended in the freedom of an imaginative leap.",

Collins was a member of the three-man crew of Apollo 11 on the first lunar landing mission, in July 1969; while his colleagues Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin explored the moon’s surface, Collins remained aboard the command module, circling in space and preparing for the critical re-docking maneuvers. Alert to the anxieties and apprehensions of both astronauts and engineers, Collins tellingly communicates the human drama of the historic flight even as he commemorates the heroic dimensions of a feat of physical, technological, and personal daring that the vagaries of modern wonder still keep us from aptly honoring. A man on the moon—imagine that!",

Themes from ancient mythology, Christian theology, and the social battlefield of the high school cafeteria have all been invoked in explaining the book’s allure, which only indicates how rewarding a tale The Hunger Games proves to be.

        "text": "While the plot of The Moonstone is compelling, it is the play of its distinctive voices upon our understanding of events that makes the book truly absorbing. Clues are laid out carefully and, in retrospect at least, quite tellingly, but their meaning is obscured as we read by the shifting perspectives and personalities of the narrators. In the same way, the exoticism of the diamond that is the story’s catalyst disguises Collins’s real invention in domesticating the melodrama of the Gothic tale and inviting its titillating energy into recognizable drawing rooms, thus laying the table for Agatha Christie and countless other novelists who would set murderous puzzles close to home. Psychological acuity, formal virtuosity, the social and human amplitude of a Victorian novel, and the narrative pulse of a thriller add up to make The Moonstone the prototype of “the book you can’t put down.”",

The twinned narratives echo and amplify each other, the author’s extraordinary sensibility—an amalgam of poetic, scientific, philosophic, and visionary impulses—blossoming in eloquent, carefully nurtured prose. Respectfully precise, his descriptions of planting, pruning, plowing, and other daily chores are filled with a hard-won practical intelligence that is happily wed to wonder. Out of all the closely observed details, and the hours of physical exertion, Collis hones earthbound meditations that transport us, on the back of his own labors, into inviting and inspiriting realms of contemplation.",

Dictated in the 1430s, it was not published in its entirety until a copy of the Middle English original was uncovered in a private British library five hundred years after its composition. In Memoirs of a Medieval Woman, Louise Collis transmutes The Book of Margery Kempe into a highly readable biographical narrative, enhancing her chronicle of her subject’s earthly adventures and heavenly exaltations with material drawn from other contemporaneous sources. The result is an enlightening tour of the medieval world in the company of a woman at once ordinary and uncommon.",

John Colville, who had joined Chamberlain’s staff the previous October (and fortuitously begun his diary the month before that), stayed on as private secretary to the indefatigable new PM. Serving thereafter at Churchill’s side for the rest of the war, as well as during Churchill’s troubled postwar return to office, Colville was able to record a prismatic, day-by-day portrait of one of history’s great leaders. Not only is this generally considered to be one of the truly indispensable books about World War II—“There is no better portrait of Churchill at the height of his powers,” said one reviewer when The Fringes of Power was first published—but it is also one of the most dramatic and vivid diaries of the twentieth century. Offering an invaluable firsthand perspective on Churchill the man and, especially, his conduct of the war, The Fringes of Power does indeed represent what Churchill biographer William Manchester called “a priceless legacy.” ",

The real joy for readers is the atmosphere the author creates through the evocation of both Victorian London and the peculiarly seductive realm of No. 221B Baker Street, where Holmes abides. The fogbound allure of the former is almost as strong as the curious and compelling air—filled with pipe smoke, the residual scent of chemical experiments, the energy inspired by Holmes’s various stimulants, and the strains of his violin—of the protagonist’s rooms; both play major roles supporting the mesmerizing ratiocinations of our hero, whose bold confidence and bracing brainpower never fail to astonish us (and, of course, the faithful Watson).

Connell brings his subject—a thrilling narrative in itself, even when simply told—to life with complex, careful sympathies. In his words, “Our nineteenth-century campaign to suppress or exterminate Indian tribes, undertaken with the best of nineteenth-century intentions, was not altogether noble. We should understand this.” By the end of this fierce, compulsively readable exploration of a legendary encounter, we do understand this truth—in all its fatal, fateful consequences. ",

        "text": "Cyril Connolly founded and edited a famous literary magazine (Horizon), wrote a novel (The Rock Pool) and several other books, and was for decades one of Britain’s most influential literary journalists and book reviewers. In his own eyes, however, this eminent man of letters was a failure because he never wrote the masterpiece that he and others expected him to produce. It was a failure he dwelt on throughout his life, never more eloquently than in the pages of this book. Detailing the formation of his own sensibility, Enemies of Promise combines personal history, advice, and shrewd critical commentary into an unconventional how-not-to guide to a literary vocation. “By turns funny, astute and elegiac”—to borrow the apt adjectives of Connolly’s biographer Jeremy Lewis—Enemies of Promise offers a bracing education for aspiring writers; it’s filled with expressive pleasures and intuitions about life and literature that will reward readers, too.

Like a distillation of the longer fiction that Conrad would write in its wake, this gripping and groundbreaking novella, despite its powerful dramatic arc, is profoundly, almost creepily unresolved.",

Through those two dimensions a small girl grows, against cultural and familial odds, into a determined young woman on the verge of a voyage to America, where she will pursue her aspirations as a historian and, ultimately, achieve renown as the first female president of Smith College. In the pages of this moving book, we witness a destiny discovering itself, as it would in a nineteenth-century novel. In fact, throughout Conway’s narrative, a reader can’t help but think of Dorothea Brooke, the heroine of George Eliot’s Middlemarch, and wonder if this is the sort of autobiography Dorothea might have penned if she had not had such an accomplished novelist to tell her tale.",

In these twenty-three shrewd and insightful exercises in “appreciative criticism” (“Most of these pieces tend to find, and rejoice in, what is best about their subjects”), Cooke celebrates “a variety of well-known people I have met, known, ‘covered,’ admired or liked throughout sixty-odd years of journalism.” His subjects are wonderfully various, ranging from Duke Ellington to Erma Bombeck, Harold Ross to Winston Churchill (“The Last Victorian” is frequently cited as an especially acute portrait), George Bernard Shaw to Eleanor Roosevelt, Gary Cooper to Robert Frost, Barry Goldwater to P. G. Wodehouse. Although the names of some of Cooke’s “well-known people” may no longer be instantly recognizable (John Nance Garner? George Aiken? Francis Chichester?), it is nonetheless a pleasure to make their acquaintance in the author’s urbane company. ",

As the nation passed quickly from ancien régime to revolution to Napoleonic Empire to restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, it seemed that Talleyrand alone was left standing in the wake of the tumultuous events. In short, Talleyrand was a character worthy of contemporary novelists such as Stendhal or Dumas. Duff Cooper, a British diplomat who served most notably as war secretary from 1935 to 1937 and as ambassador to France from 1944 to 1948, follows his chameleon protagonist through a forest of intrigues with perfect pace and style, distilling facts and incidents into polished prose that is a joy to read.",

The Last of the Mohicans is the second in the series of five Leatherstocking Tales that James Fenimore Cooper wrote about Natty; it followed The Pioneers, a portrait of frontier life at the end of the nineteenth century in which Bumppo appears as an old man. The character in the first novel proved so popular that Cooper brought him back, this time in the prime of life. Cooper’s exciting, action-packed yarns helped shaped the romantic notion of the pre-Revolutionary American wilderness as a stage for nobility of character and resourceful courage. Although not always historically accurate, they do imbue the uncorrupted forest with an imaginative promise that reflects the overwhelming power the unsettled continent had in shaping the fears and fortunes of the early colonists. That promise found no better embodiment than Natty Bumppo, and Natty had no better adventure than The Last of the Mohicans.",

        "text": "Torregreca is an extraordinary social document, a candid account of a Protestant American woman’s encounter with the Catholic, peasant culture of southern Italy as it endured through the late 1950s. Arriving in an impoverished village (here called Torregreca) in the region of Basilicata with the intention of establishing a nursery school for the benefit of its denizens, the author quickly becomes the subject of gossip as an independent woman in a society bound by ancient spells of tradition that have only slowly dissipated across the centuries. The clash of cultures is both comic and poignant, but Cornelisen’s resourcefulness in the face of the medieval, almost metaphysical sense of futility that holds the villagers in thrall is unremitting. At its heart, Torregreca is the moving testament of a sensibility reshaped by its encounter with the obdurate truths of a foreign reality. It is a work of great humanity and nobility—of storytelling in the best, most fundamental sense. ",

Something similar to a man who has never tasted peaches. He would be quietly getting sadder, noticeably paler, and, probably, little by little, he would lose his hair.” Neruda’s fantastical warning sets just the right tone for a consideration of the highly imaginative work of Julio Cortázar, a leading light of the Latin American literary boom that exploded in the 1960s.",

The disc caused a sensation on its initial release, and it remains one of the bestselling classical albums of all time. Though Gould went on to enjoy an outstanding career, he became as famous for his eccentricities as for his brilliant, if often controversial, musicianship. Gould’s conversation makes for refreshing, exhilarating, thought-stretching reading: You’ll finish this book feeling amused and smarter—more alert to the playful and profound powers of both music and mind. If you already know a thing or two about classical music, you’ll find it all deeply absorbing; if you’re unfamiliar with the genre, you’re likely to find yourself inspired to rectify that situation as soon as possible, with Gould’s own recordings of Bach leading the way.

Beginning in 1948, when Craft was twenty-five, he joined the Stravinsky household as a sort of musical acolyte to the maestro, but he soon became a confidant—indeed, a surrogate son—to the composer and his wife, Vera. In the diary entries that compose this book, Craft’s erudition in matters of music and culture illuminates with insight, wit, and at times sardonic canniness the rarefied personalities and situations he was fortunate to witness firsthand.

        "text": "The Red Badge of Courage is an American classic and a landmark in the literature of war. Yet it is a book that is very easy to understand too quickly. Although it is subtitled An Episode of the American Civil War, the novel offers little detail specific to the War Between the States other than the blue and the gray of the respective combatants’ uniforms. For all its naturalism and gritty engagement of the experience of battle, the book constantly reaches beyond its immediate realities to fulfill the author’s intention, as expressed in a letter to a friend, of writing “a psychological portrait of fear.” Although The Red Badge of Courage is deservedly praised for the groundbreaking realism of its depiction of a soldier’s experience, what’s most original about the book is its insistence on the primacy of what is going on in Henry’s head: That’s where the battle to become a man is fought, Crane’s tale suggests, and that is a battle that is never really won.

Wells’s The Time Machine or Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World (a title Crichton would borrow for his prequel to Jurassic Park). In a word, they’re unputdownable. ",

Fast, funny, and whimsically winning, The Moving Toyshop is a comic fantasia disguised as a donnish detective story. We follow Fen and Cadogan through scenes of madcap invention (the scene in which they pursue a witness through an orchestra and choir rehearsal is priceless) until the mystery of the disappearing toyshop is unraveled and we are rather drunk with a peculiar joy. There are ten more Crispin volumes to supply the hair of the dog.",

Rare is the novel that taps this clear spring of imagination, but John Crowley’s 1981 fantasy, Little, Big, is one that does. A willing suspension of disbelief and the author’s winsome gifts for words and wonder will soon have you spellbound. Playful and capacious, Little, Big is a fey and fateful fable of what it means for an individual to find a place in the larger world.",

Simultaneously intimate and expansive, his poems achieve what the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry labeled “a magnificent, subversive smallness.” His many sonnets, eccentric though they be, are among the best of the twentieth century, combining rhymes and off-rhymes with a casual confidence; his love poems are equally distinguished, putting linguistic virtuosity at the service of erotic longing (and, as he might say, nearing) with an ingenuity reminiscent of seventeenth-century metaphysical master John Donne. Beneath their beguiling (and at times befuddling) façades, Cummings’s poems do serious work, encouraging the language into new powers of expression. His poetry proves, again and again, that no familiarity—not dawn nor death nor laughter nor love—is quite as straightforward as it seems.",

This book doesn’t just document one of the signal events of the history of our hemisphere. It calls into question the entire positivist orientation of the nineteenth century, the belief in an inevitable march of progress, which, as humanity would learn to its horror, was setting the stage for a darker era to come. The terrors of religious fundamentalism and crusading government retribution are as relevant in our day as they were in Cunha’s, and in Rebellion in the Backlands we see the tragic consequences of these furious energies.",

        "text": "Virginia Woolf’s 1925 novel Mrs. Dalloway, set on a single June day in London, is punctuated by the tolling of Big Ben, the bell inside the clock tower at the Houses of Parliament. Its regular marking of the time—“First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable”—reminds Clarissa Dalloway of both the day’s passage and the evanescence of all things. This indelible symbol provided Woolf’s novel with its working title: The Hours. Seven decades on, Michael Cunningham, a writer of uncommon sensitivity and an unabashed Woolf lover, retrieved it for his best novel, a stunning invocation of Mrs. Dalloway and a masterful fiction in its own right. The Hours (1998) is a book that leaves the reader feeling hopeful and blessed, suffused with the ever-present, ineffable wonder of life. Really.",

His parting shot was fittingly titled The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody. From the Egypt of the pharaohs to the Athens of Pericles, from Hannibal and his elephants to Attila and his Huns, from merrie olde England to the shores of America, Cuppy enters the lists of history and returns unimpressed. His tour of the past is conducted without reverence, awe, or wonder, and his deadpan narrative cuts women (Lady Godiva, Lucrezia Borgia, and Madame du Barry) and men (Henry VIII, Philip II of Spain—“Philip the Sap” to our distinguished author—Columbus, Montezuma, and Miles Standish) down to size with equal comic zeal.",

From The Gremlins (1943) to The Minpins (1991), Dahl created marvelous confections for young readers for nearly five decades. Standing out among his storytelling treats is Matilda, whose superheroine is heroic—and triumphant—first and foremost because she loves to read. When a small girl vanquishes oppressive adults, what young reader won’t experience a vicarious thrill? Indeed, a good portion of Dahl’s popularity can be traced to the fact that he never underestimates young people, either as readers or as protagonists. What Dahl brought to writing for kids was an irreverence that proved to be the raison d’être of his art—a verve that, because it strikes an incorrigible chord with even the best behaved of his readers, conjures a liberating energy all too seldom captured between covers.",

Adventures large and small met him and his various companions at every stage of the trip, and the author’s style is supple enough to engagingly capture both current realities and the spectral presences of the past.

It’s about loss and longing and love, all three as present and unpredictable as weather: the atmosphere of our solace and sorrow, which the chambers of our days—bedrooms, workplaces, churches—can never quite contain, although that sorrow and that solace have nowhere else to go.

Most of Darwin’s writings are characterized by an inviting congeniality, born of the social milieu that shaped him. Yet none of Darwin’s other books possess the sense of adventure and emergent discovery inherent in The Voyage of the Beagle; these qualities give its pages a lasting freshness and fascination.",

Even when you are unfamiliar with the subject of Davenport’s focus, you’re likely to be enthralled by what he sees; his abiding theme is the making and meaning of culture, and he follows it through thickets and forests with unerring step, clearing unseen paths for his readers. Reeducating our eyes, metaphorically speaking, is Davenport’s program, as he wends his graceful way through the ideas of writers, thinkers, and artists in essays that are discursive, witty, learned, and bold, filled with enough ideas per page to keep one thinking for a week. The Geography of the Imagination is the kind of book that makes us better readers: more curious, more perceptive, and more likely to discover connections ourselves.",

Tracks tells the story of Davidson's six-month, 1,700-mile journey through a timeless landscape inhabited by strange and sometimes threatening life forms. Given to passionate ruminations on the false reality a camera can capture, the Aboriginal way of life, and the pleasures and powers of solitude, Davidson is also stubborn, resourceful, and tough. She survives the onslaughts of both nature and civilization to tell her tale with a robust, wry humor that is vivid and engaging. A genuinely unforgettable trek.",

The Deptford Trilogy follows the unforeseen and ever-widening effects of that misguided prank at the start of Fifth Business across decades and continents, through the lives of many characters and into realms of religion, psychology, and magic. From page one, the reader is lured into a high-spirited and often very funny chase—after passing facts, ultimate truths, and continuous entertainment—by a virtuoso storyteller. The three novels—each of which, remarkably, stands on its own and can be read independently of the others—echo and amplify one another. The first novel, Fifth Business, focuses on Dunstan Ramsay, the boy who ducked, tracing his life as a soldier, teacher, and scholar of saints in the enduring shadows of Percy “Boy” Staunton, young snowball thrower and eventual business titan, and Mary Dempster, the unfortunate—but perhaps holy—target of the errant projectile. The tale begins with the wintry incident and ends with Boy Staunton’s death decades later in mysterious circumstances. It is a fast-paced narrative in which the author’s gifts for observation and invention summon into being a reality that is both familiar and deliciously weird, peopled—like the tales of Dickens—with characters whose attributes are exaggerated to a degree that refines, rather than destroys, our recognition of their essential humanity.

It was such a success that its title has entered the lexicon. But the title, as Dawkins has admitted, is a bit of a misnomer. He doesn’t believe in a selfishness gene that helps certain organisms survive and propagate. Instead, he argues that Darwin’s survival of the fittest takes place not at the level of the species or even the single organism, but at the much deeper level of genetic material. Other kinds of “replicators,” not just genes, have evolutionary force, and to fully understand evolution, Dawkins writes, we need to understand not just biology but culture, not just genes but memes. And that makes The Selfish Gene an essential book not just for scientists, but for anyone evolving through our tumultuous intellectual age.",

While Day has lately been put forth for canonization by the church, she might bridle at that idea: “Don’t call me a saint,” she once wrote, “I don’t want to be dismissed that easily.” In any case, like Saint Augustine, she spent her early years in the embrace of worldly pursuits—“the wisdom of the flesh is treacherous indeed” she would later reflect—before a conversion led her to focus her considerable energy on “[making] it a little simpler for people to feed, clothe and shelter themselves as God intended them to do.” Her personal testament is as revelatory as Augustine’s Confessions, although the difference in the two books’ perspectives is striking: Where Augustine’s autobiography is a conversation with God, Day’s narrative is a conversation with the world.",

You might at first think that such an approach to the estimable Monsieur Proust has to be tongue in cheek, if not an outright joke. De Botton, however, while charmingly playful, is indeed serious about looking to the pages of Proust’s great book, and even to Proust’s eccentric life, for such guidance. ",

        "text": "From its opening pages, with its sonorous invocation of the exalted idea of France’s special destiny that was Charles de Gaulle’s treasured inheritance, this eloquent testament records the confluence of national and personal fortunes that determined his course through the years of Nazi occupation, as he fled to London in 1940 to organize the Free French forces and establish a government-in-exile. Throughout his chronicle, de Gaulle’s military education brings a vivid practical dimension to his commentary and analysis, while his fierce loyalty to the sovereignty and heritage of France provokes innumerable confrontations with the Allied High Command. The product of an overwhelming personality in all its ego and honor, self-justification and courage, stubbornness and vision, these memoirs evoke the military, political, and cultural themes of France’s midcentury crisis with great eloquence and dignity. To read them is to discover that Churchill was not the only great writer among the Allied leadership.",

The enduring 1926 bestseller by bacteriologist-turned-writer Paul de Kruif is a colorful account of the careers and discoveries of the pioneers of the microscopic world. Presenting these scientific trailblazers as the “hunters,” “explorers,” and “fighters of death” that they truly were—including some “done to death by the immensely small assassins they were studying”—de Kruif infuses his profiles with an extra dose of drama that brings a page-turning pleasure to the real scientific history he imparts.",

That figure has been brought to vivid, complex life in his daughter’s generous and wholly original book.  In this questing, good-humored, heartfelt memoir, Dianne Tittle de Laet weaves family history, football lore, and her own vocations as poet, harpist, and classicist into a curious and lifelike tapestry of biography and anecdote, reminiscence and affection.

Now he was rereading the Iliad as part of a midlife adventure: going back to college with the specific purpose of reading his way through his alma mater’s two core-curriculum (i.e., “great books”) courses. In the company of students and professors, with his own family life (as son, husband, parent) and career providing both context and commentary, Denby considers the contours of our culture and the transmission of its traditions as he celebrates the “special character of solitude and rapture” the act of reading still engenders, despite the reverberating acoustics of the “media cave” in which we live.",

        "text": "The success of the Indian independence movement, which ended British rule in 1947, has always been tempered by a painful legacy: the partition of the British raj into two sovereign states, divided by religion. The creation of Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan bred years of violence and displacement that have matured into permanent unrest. And as Anita Desai shows in Clear Light of Day, a moving and atmospheric novel suffused with heat, sound, and heartache, the partition of India cleaved families apart as well. Filled with insight into the legacy of partition, Clear Light of Day is very much a family novel. It’s a story of secrets, regrets, jealousy, commitment, forgiveness, and love, through which Desai evokes the easy-to-mask but impossible-to-disguise verity that one can never leave one’s family.",

English and Spanish and Spanglish combine to energize the sentences, which move easily between different modes of discourse—expository, conversational, professorial, confidential, ribald, tender, rambunctious—but never stray for long from speech rhythms. Now shouting, now murmuring, now explaining or exhorting, the voice of the narrator—a man named Yunior, as we will eventually discover—relates the life of his friend Oscar de Leon, an overweight, nerdy, sensitive boy possessed of—or more exactly by—what Díaz has called “outré interests.” Yunior’s narration also encompasses the times of Oscar’s family (including his sister, Lola, Yunior’s former love), immigrants to New Jersey from the Dominican Republic. The book’s style is powerful, and it needs to be, because it must treat several spheres of action and dimensions of experience, diverse in register and implication. Along the way, the story bounces back and forth between yearning and nostalgia, tenderness and violence, nerdiness and nobility, anguish and—not least, and almost inexplicably—joy.",

Despite the thriller-like political machinations and a few melodramatic set pieces, the real allure of the book lies in its depiction of fully realized individuals striving with varying degrees of both hypocrisy and authenticity to live right lives in a wrong environment. By turning upside down the postwar structures and balances that the reader knows by heart, Philip K. Dick illustrates the essential arbitrariness of the universe—and the need for empathy when victor becomes vanquished, and vice versa.",

Dickens famously called Copperfield the “favourite child” of his literary brood, and its autobiographical frame goes some way toward explaining why. The eighth of his novels to be written, it is the first one narrated in the first person, and, from the opening words, the direct address of the protagonist is captivating. The coming-of-age tale that David relates has many points of contact with Dickens’s own experiences as the son of a debtor, as an adolescent employee in a factory, as a parliamentary reporter, and, lastly, as a successful novelist.",

Abandoning the pleasures of the picaresque and the improvisatory impulses of his earlier novels, it gains in their stead a surer sense of structure and thematic coherence, allowing Dickens to inform his story with a more focused social consciousness. As a result, in concert with telling the tale of a man of business and his family, the narrative of Dombey and Son illuminates the tumultuous changes wrought, in mid-nineteenth-century England, by the Industrial Revolution and the rise of mercantile culture. Throughout, Dickens writes with a confidence that makes this novel, although one of his lesser known, among his most satisfying. ",

Echoing the dichotomies invoked in its opening sentences, the work unfolds in a series of parallels and mirrorings, alternating between London and Paris in the years before and during the French Revolution. Despite being among its author’s most widely read novels, A Tale of Two Cities is the least Dickensian. Swept along by the rapid movement of the complex plot, and the frantic history that propels it, the narrative reveals character through action and incident rather than through Dickens’s more typical reliance on dialogue and personality quirks. Missing, too, is the sense of comedy that leavens and enlivens even the darkest of his other books. As a consequence, A Tale of Two Cities is the neatest storytelling contrivance in Dickens’s oeuvre.",

All of the author’s famous gifts are on display in this cheering fable of a miser’s Christmas Eve metamorphosis from misanthrope to man of good will, including his talent for deft characterization (in the figure, for instance, of Scrooge’s clerk, the put-upon but ever hopeful Bob Cratchit); for poignant sentiment (in the figure of Cratchit’s lame son, Tiny Tim); and for ingenious monikers (was any curmudgeon ever more aptly named than Ebenezer Scrooge?).",

Unlike those other two novels, which, of course, have their own ardent champions, Bleak House is not steeped in childhood or focused on the unfolding of a childhood’s layers of hopes and sorrows in later life; it is a novel of adulthood, a nuanced exploration of social mores, economic and legal entanglement, romantic passion, mature love, and murderous envy. Innovative in its structure, it is told in two distinct and alternating voices. This capacious book seems to be a compendium of everything its author had learned about inventing characters and telling stories. It weaves several strands of popular (or soon to be popular) fiction—social satire, romance, sentimental education, the novel of sensation, and the detective story—into a single vast tapestry of reading that is surprising, intellectually compelling, and wholly satisfying.",

Anchored in a Kentish village, around which the years and events of the complicated plot will revolve, the book returns Dickens to his native ground in search not of autobiographical details, but of the familiar spirits and psychological tempers that nurtured his imagination: the injuries of class, the uncertainties of love, the snobberies of fashion, the limited purview of personal agency, the coincidence—or is it more?—that links crime and fortune, or goodness and inequity. In the end, Great Expectations is not really about expectation at all, but about regret, and as powerfully so as any book in our language.",

As Oliver progresses from workhouse minion to undertaker’s assistant to conscript in the thieving army of urchin pickpockets led by the Artful Dodger and in thrall to the seedy ringleader Fagin, the reader is treated to a searing social satire on the treatment of paupers and bereft children, a vivid portrait of the urban criminal underworld, and a suspenseful if murky plot that is a roller coaster of melodramatic hopes and fears, degradations and redemptions.",

Later that evening, they returned to their Manhattan apartment and sat down to dinner. They talked about their day. In the middle of their conversation, John slumped in his chair, raised his hand, and died. “John was talking, then he wasn’t,” Didion writes in this spare and deeply affecting mourning diary, one of the most significant books of recent times to reckon with the weight and obligations imposed by death, and by the untethering from normalcy grief brings. What is most moving in Didion’s anatomy of grief is that it offers no false comfort. In the wake of tragedy, we may hope to find in books some testament that the worst will pass if only we “work through” our pain. Nothing doing. Coming to terms with death, Didion shows us, means coming to the only terms it allows, which are the same as life’s, but lonelier: “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” And there’s something so true and nourishing in the telling here that The Year of Magical Thinking seems—paradoxically—a necessary, life-enhancing miracle, and a boon to those whose grief is boundless.",

In the fifteen essays gathered here, Dillard bears witness to the passing glories of the seasons and nature’s enduring beauty and violence. The personal narrative she unhurriedly unravels through her descriptions of her outings, her study of grasshoppers and praying mantises, her observation of newts and herons—to say nothing of her engagement with the thoughts of sages as diverse as Werner Heisenberg and Julian of Norwich—is vivid and intimate.",

Writing in a stately, distinctive English (she translated her works back into her native tongue for their Danish publication), Dinesen created an atmosphere that blended the abiding steadiness of the fairy tale with the heightened psychic sensitivities of Gothic themes. The apprehension that her style creates is complemented by what might be called the intrinsically foreign, at times even otherworldly, nature of her settings. Suffused with both the ominous darkness and the glad promise of folktales, her stories are polished to a gem-like brilliance by this modern master’s singular finesse.",

        "text": "Ragtime is first and foremost a good read, animated with complex characters, real and invented, and several absorbing plotlines that intersect in the narrative’s ingenious design. The layering of fiction and fact, ephemera and history, headline news and private heartache is alluring, giving the book a surface glamour that is at once entertaining and compelling. Equally captivating are the juxtapositions of poverty and wealth, leisure and labor, sex and politics, idea and emotion. And although it is lucidly declarative, it is peculiarly told: There is a matter-of-factness to Doctorow’s prose, no matter how outlandish its content, that keeps the telling—appropriately enough given the book’s title—a little offbeat. The narrative itself is syncopated, playing off our expectations of history to present an entirely new music, one that holds us in thrall and creates no little sense of wonder.",

It is the story of three survivors (Ivan, his father, and his maternal grandmother), and of the environment—the hardscrabble world of Montana sheep ranching—that shaped them all, and which they each outlasted. Doig was blessed with a gift for refreshing common experience and everyday struggle with the benediction of the right words. In powerful writing about the landscape of Montana and the influence it has exerted on the spirit and culture of its inhabitants; about ranching and its associated works and days; about memory, family, and all the ramifications of kinship, Doig poignantly charts the translation of experience from labor to language across the generations.

John Donne’s most famous phrases come down to us as if from a pulpit, wearing the solemn dress of the meditations and devotions from which they spring. And although he was indeed a brilliant religious writer in both verse and prose, his reputation as the greatest of the seventeenth-century English Metaphysical poets rests as much on poems of a more earthly nature. Donne’s art, in the prose of his sermons on mortality and salvation as well as in his poetry, is one of construction as much as thought: He chooses his materials and fits them together in the same way a joiner builds a cabinet, creating objects that are strong, useful, enduring, beautiful. Unexpected speech rhythms give his lines a tension between relaxation and constraint that moves across the two extremes of his sensibility—sensual and religious—and defines a style wholly his own.",

They were bold at the time of writing (the 1930s) and remain striking today.

Trilogy is like a vast history painting, a montage of carefully constructed panels juxtaposed to create a composite “voice” more vivid, more resourceful, more impersonal, and more capacious than that heard in ordinary literary composition. Through it all, we revel in the author’s keen eye for the headlines, news flashes, and song lyrics that shaped the public mind in the first flush of mass media (how prescient Dos Passos was in his understanding of both its stimulating and stupefying effects). So although the trilogy may be at times dated in expression, it is also alive with a kind of scriptural foreshadowing, intuitive in its understanding of our enduring national character and the conflicts at the core of it—between capitalism and the commonweal, finance and labor, the individual and the community, the familiar and the strange, the little guy and the big guy, us and them. Indeed, if U.S.A. has been out of fashion, it may be time for it to come back in: It’s like a reading of the entrails of American modernity, a prophecy that is wise to the collective nature of the democratic enterprise and therefore alert to the disillusion that can threaten it when our sense of all-being-in-this-together is more real as phantom than as fact.

Fyodor Dostoevsky’s first major novel poses these questions in the tale of a man who enacts brutal crimes in order to break the strictures of his social destiny. For Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, the handsome but penniless “ex-student” at the center of Crime and Punishment, the Saint Petersburg of the 1860s is a cesspit of nepotists and shysters. He convinces himself it would be no worse off without a certain greedy pawnbroker; it might even be a better place if she were eliminated.  Of all the big, fat Russian novels of the nineteenth century, this one may be the most accessible—and the questions it poses about our desires and responsibilities remain as fresh as ever.",

A very unreliable narrator—he’s never named, though critics refer to him as the Underground Man—can’t wait to show us how miserable life can be. Although the narrator is always on the brink of collapse, the author is in total control, skewering the utilitarian and positivist ideals gaining currency in Russia at the time of writing. Today Notes from Underground endures less as a political text than as a bold, brilliant character study, an indelible portrait of a man at the margins. It doesn’t just pave the way for Dostoevsky’s later, grander novels of alienation: In its rambling form and philosophical complexity, Notes from Underground paves the way for the entirety of modernism.",

His eloquence and passion won him renown, but also stoked rumors that he had never been a slave at all, for how could any former field hand speak like Cicero? Dismayed and hungry for justice, Douglass sat down to write this first version of his autobiography; its success didn’t just silence his detractors, it brought new power to the growing chorus of citizens raising their voices in support of abolition. Douglass’s Narrative was not the first account by a former American slave of life in bondage, but it was undoubtedly the most influential.",

Soon enough disillusioned by the reality of her meager new life, she will scrape and scheme and love and fall on hard times—use and be used—before ultimately finding the material success she seeks, as an actress in New York City. Writing with an earnestness that granted society more agency and potency than any novelist before him, save perhaps Balzac, had allowed, Dreiser pioneered an American naturalism that left a path for Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, Saul Bellow, and several generations of other accomplished novelists to follow.",

        "text": "“I sit with Shakespeare and he winces not,” writes the author of The Souls of Black Folk, embracing the Bard’s iambic pentameter to claim learning and culture as rights akin to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Indeed, the biography of William Edward Burghardt Du Bois might merit a Shakespearean drama of its own, for it began during the era of Civil War Reconstruction and ended at the height of the civil rights movement—Du Bois died, in Ghana, on the eve of the March on Washington that would culminate in the “I have a dream” oratory of Martin Luther King Jr. In the decades in between, Du Bois studied with William James, became the first African American to receive a PhD from Harvard, publicly advocated for integration and equality in opposition to the more gradualist programs of Booker T. Washington, cofounded the NAACP, and was a pioneer in the field of social science. His powerful mind found its most memorable expression in this collection published in 1903. Comprising fourteen essays that blend history, philosophy, sociological observation, human interest, and personal experience with extraordinary eloquence, The Souls of Black Folk asks trenchant questions (“How does it feel to be a problem?” “Would America have been America without her Negro people?”) and answers them with a compassionate consideration of the brutal realities that shape African American lives and a sophisticated understanding of the complicated legacies of slavery.",

The “I” is the novel’s unnamed narrator. She is a timid and inexperienced young woman who, after a whirlwind romance, becomes the wife of the handsome and sophisticated widower Maxim de Winter. Manderley is de Winter’s isolated estate on the Cornish coast of England. When the couple takes up residence there, the new Mrs. de Winter discovers that although her predecessor, the beautiful Rebecca, is dead, her memory lives on. Rebecca unfolds with what one reviewer called “the relentlessness of a vivid nightmare.” As the New York Times put it, “du Maurier is in a class by herself”—and Rebecca is her finest achievement.",

Duff is especially good at translating what can be found between covers into a wider knowledge of life, sharing insight on how books are gateways not only to the meaning and use (and fun) of words, but to art, music, nature, and research as well.

Aspiring to join their ranks as a musketeer,\nd’Artagnan follows his temper and his taste for amorous entanglement into perilous situations from which his new friends must extricate him. Duels, romantic liaisons, and court intrigue come fast and furious as the dialogue-driven chapters fly by. Literary entertainment gets no better than this: You’ll lose hours and hours of valuable time, and relish every moment.",

As Dantès is transformed from an earnest, responsible young sailor into the unforgettable figure who gives the book its title, he comes to combine the attributes of Odysseus, Robin Hood, a Western gunslinger, and James Bond, meting out his artful and implacable justice with equal doses of vindictiveness and generosity.

Although that not inconsiderable journey would take a year, it proved to be only the first step in Ibn Battuta’s life of unparalleled peregrination. Over the next three decades, he traveled more than seventy-five thousand miles almost entirely by land, visiting Egypt and Persia, Samarkand and Constantinople, Sumatra and modern Tanzania, the Crimea and the southern steppes of Russia, Granada and Mali, even India, Ceylon, and China. Using Ibn Battuta’s own account of his journeys as his primary source, Ross E. Dunn chronicles his insatiably curious subject’s exploits as scholar, diplomat, companion of royalty, even as a victim of pirates. But he also draws on history outside of the Rihlah to place its protagonist in a rich cultural context, creating a complex history of the vibrant and sophisticated Muslim world Ibn Battuta traversed.",

Any saga is enhanced by the knowledge that our pleasure in its unfolding will continue beyond the bounds of the volume in hand, that the world in which we’ve invested our imagination will pay interest for hundreds and hundreds of pages to come. That’s but one of the pleasures promised and delivered by Dorothy Dunnett’s captivating, erudite, and addictive historical novels known as The Lymond Chronicles. Set in Scotland, England, Europe, and the Middle East in the middle of the sixteenth century—between the Scottish border wars of the late 1540s and the coronation of Elizabeth I at the start of 1559—they tell the tale of Francis Crawford, an outlaw Scottish nobleman endowed with both a hero’s bearing and a maverick’s recalcitrance. Intricately plotted and carefully researched, Dunnett’s novels are imbued with romance and irony in equal measure. The author’s mastery of suspense complements the vigor of her invention as she follows her protagonist across a large historical canvas peopled with many historical figures.",

At an unnamed Franciscan abbey—housing a labyrinth in which is hidden the greatest library in Christendom, including forbidden works of uncanny and encoded knowledge—monks are suspected of heresy, and Brother William of Baskerville, a master logician, is dispatched to investigate. Demonstrating uncommon deductive skills upon his arrival, William is soon asked to apply his keen mind to an unexpected matter. A manuscript illuminator from the abbey’s scriptorium has fallen to his death outside the monastery walls: Is it suicide or murder? So begins The Name of the Rose, the most unlikely of modern international bestsellers (there are more than a few passages in Latin!).",

Set in an environment surprisingly hospitable to life despite great kingdoms being at war, Ouroboros is a glorious cross between Norse sagas, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and interplanetary sagas still to be invented; it revolves, as Lewis rightly asserted, in a rarefied orbit of its own.",

Edelman set out to discover how the phenomenon of mind emerges from the brain’s bundle of tissue. Bright Air, Brilliant Fire summarizes for a general audience Edelman’s researches and speculations, which have met with some controversy and criticism, especially from advocates of a computational, rather than a strictly biological, view of the brain’s functioning. His book is dense with reports on the dance of neurons, their connections, and their patterns; it is vivid with opinion and experiment, and animated by Edelman’s erudition in the arts as well as the sciences; it is often witty, at times difficult; it is, finally, exhilarating in its sweeping vision of how we, quite literally, make up our minds as we go along.",

Along the way, he delivers a long, rich, intricate story filled with friendship, kinship, feuds, sorrow, love, humor, tragedy, and joy—in other words, with real life passionately experienced and fervently embraced. Animating his fictional alter ego’s narrative with Guernsey accents and French patois, Edwards created a style that is vibrant and beautiful, wholly original and yet never obscure. In it he renders a world complete, with, in Nobel Prize winner William Golding’s words, “such inbuilt authenticity you hardly seem to be reading at all, but living.”",

The answer might well be something very much like A Visit from the Goon Squad, Jennifer Egan’s virtuosic and open-hearted tale of music and mortality. Like the music it evokes, Goon Squad is catchy, inviting in both form and duration: It moves with the tempo and tunefulness of rock ’n’ roll. In fact, like a vintage pop LP, it’s divided into two “sides,” A and B. Each chapter is a kind of musical track as well, a freestanding “song” that slots into the larger concept album; each takes place in a different time period, from the late 1960s into some year in the near future; each focuses on a different character; and each is written in a distinct narrative style (one chapter, devoted to “Great Rock & Roll Pauses,” is composed in PowerPoint slides). All of us, Egan suggests, get mugged by the “goon squad” of time. And none of us really sees it coming.",

He received his PhD in 1937 and became the chairman of the anthropology department at the University of Pennsylvania in 1947. A decade later, The Immense Journey, a collection of thirteen poetic, ruminative essays on our evolutionary history and relationship to the natural world, became a popular and critical success. The catalysts for the speculations gathered in The Immense Journey range from a crack in a sandstone wall to the magic of flowing water, from the mysteries of the ocean’s bottom to how the emergence of flowering plants changed the face of the planet. Eiseley wears his scientific learning lightly, and often uses it to amplify the meanings of an observation we might well have made ourselves. Best of all, he enlarges his scientist’s perspective with the capacity of a gifted writer’s words; these are essays that—in the beauty and measure of their language—inspire in the reader the kind of serene, profound engagement with existence that is both exhilarating and, in the deepest sense, restorative.",

Now formal and now free, Eliot’s verse wends its way through these locations like the river he invokes at the outset of “The Dry Salvages”: strong, flowing, impersonal and inspiring, animated with currents of consolation and desire that cannot measure the meaning of existence, but merely, and truly, carry it along. There is no other book of poetry quite like Four Quartets.",

Ellis here focuses on six specific incidents that illustrate the founders’ wrangling, ranging from widely known events to clandestine encounters. He puts his close knowledge of the historical context in the service of the reader, illuminating the issues of the day with insight and erudition. It’s hard to imagine a better introduction to the period—or to the small library of bestselling books on the revolutionary generation—than Founding Brothers.",

        "text": "Emerson was a philosopher, poet, and essayist. Though he’s credited with being one of the fathers of Transcendentalism, the New England movement that privileged idealism over empiricism and found a natural divinity in all things, he valued independent thought above adherence to any creed or system. Since the best of Emerson is the phrase, the sentence, the paragraph—call it the majestic sound bite (he was, after all, a riveting public speaker)—the best way to approach his work may be to just open it anywhere and start reading.",

The first piece, “A Few Words About Breasts,” reveals her approach, mixing reflection, finely tuned social antennae, and a self-awareness both shrewd and funny, all the while evincing the disorienting self-assessment that is central to the wider context of American womanhood. She writes about the growing pains of the women’s movement with both insight and impatience, and about figures of contemporary notoriety, from porn star Linda Lovelace to presidential secretary Rose Mary Woods, with a nose for both news and the deeper scents of cultural meaning.",

Its title character was a historical king who ruled the Mesopotamian city of Uruk in the first half of the third millennium BC. The tale centers on the friendship between Gilgamesh, an arrogant and grasping ruler, and Enkidu, a wild creature who, once humanized by the arts of eros embodied by the priestess Shamhat, becomes the king’s friend and inseparable companion, but only after he and Gilgamesh engage in a fierce fight. As the narrative unfolds from the initial hubris to the ultimate humbling of its hero, Gilgamesh is ennobled by his discovery of friendship, his experience of grief, and his acceptance of the human condition. For our part as readers, we are filled with wonder at witnessing the contours and powers of the human imagination invoked with primal urgency and eloquence.",

        "text": "Waspish, subversive, bitingly ironic, and endlessly entertaining, Praise of Folly has endured for five hundred years as a masterpiece of humanistic inquiry and opposition to dogmatism. The book begins as a straight satire. Folly, in the guise of a jester, speaks for herself in a parodic declamation, insisting she is the world’s greatest benefactor—desire, flattery, youth, and vitality all follow her lead, and Jupiter himself has to fall in behind her when he wants to father a child. When someone observes that no humans have ever built a house of worship for her, Folly first responds with a droll observation: “I cannot but wonder at the ingratitude.” Yet Praise of Folly soon pivots from this cheeky beginning, and the goddess becomes a mouthpiece through which the author propounds more serious themes. Half a millennium on, the power of Erasmus’s masterpiece has not waned; in fact, it’s both disturbingly and providentially relevant in our contemporary moment, when religious belief and humanistic scrutiny are often violently opposed.",

The story is told by a collective narrator, a “we” who speaks for a group of boys who, as adolescents, are besotted with the mystifying Lisbon sisters, and, as adults, have remained transfixed by memories of the girls’ mysterious lives and unfortunate ends. Summoning a voice that embodies with expressive exactitude a quality of growing up that has slipped through the sentences of most novels concerned with it, Eugenides captures its nature as a communal experience with breathtaking, heartbreaking sympathy.",

Only a few months before this tragedy was first staged, Athenian forces had imposed the same brutal terms of massacre and enslavement on the citizenry of Melos in retribution for that island city’s refusal to join the alliance against Athens’s rival, Sparta. By telescoping for his audience the foregone grief of the Trojan women with the fresh suffering of their counterparts on Melos, Euripides created a work that has endured as one of the most powerful expressions of the human costs of militarism and war, a play both artful and authentic in equal measure.",

It takes a vengeful god, perhaps—and a dramatist of genius, certainly—to force us to see so deeply into the mystery of what it means to be human.",

For all the misbehavior and bizarre characters Exley embraces with abandon, the sentences he composes in the shadow of “that long malaise, my life” are filled with an energy and rueful humor that are infectious and unforgettable.

        "text": "Addie Bundren’s health is deteriorating rapidly, and her eldest son, Cash, is hewing the most beautiful coffin he can manage right outside her bedroom window. Wretchedly poor, the Bundrens watch Addie die, then make their way with her corpse, its coffin in a mule-drawn wagon, across the fictional Yoknapatawpha County to fulfill her wish to be buried in her hometown of Jefferson. Along the way, they curse and fight and scream and hallucinate over the loss of the woman who held their lives together, enduring flood, fire, and all sorts of other calamities. It’s so blackly comic that laughter is eclipsed by a state of fretful, threatened animation that is part Gothic grotesquerie, part ramshackle picaresque, and part Old Testament. In the estimation of the critic Harold Bloom, As I Lay Dying “may be the most original novel ever written by an American.” But originality has its price. It can be tough going for the reader, even if, in comparison to his earlier novel The Sound and the Fury—which Faulkner himself described to his agent as “a real son of a bitch”—As I Lay Dying is a slightly easier read.",

He summons his own grandeur out of thin air and polishes it with the sweat of slaves. The saga of Thomas Sutpen and his heirs is a story of people who, as one character puts it, outlive themselves by years and years and years, just as Sutpen’s design will dissipate across the decades.",

In it, he bravely indulged the experimental impulse that, under the guidance of his editors, he had kept in check in his previously published work, creating one of the landmarks of modern—and modernist—fiction. The book comprises four sections, three set on the days of Easter weekend in 1928, and one (the second as ordered in the novel) set eighteen years earlier. Together, they brood on thirty years of sorrow in the life of the Compson family, aristocratic Southerners whose fortunes have fallen far and messily, and whose members cannot come to grips with their loss of financial stature, local prestige, moral compass, and meaningful relation to their land, their history, and each other.",

Lena Grove is a pregnant, unmarried young woman looking for the father of her child; Joe Christmas, who arrived three years earlier, is a drifter whose orphanhood haunts his every relation and whose appetites are mired in flesh and blood. The pair heads a dramatis personae that reads like the character checklist handed out on the first day of a Southern Gothic writing course. All are caught in the violence of a present so remote from any alternative future that their inner lives have no direction. Their identities are in thrall to poverty, racism, ignorance, and intolerance, and the sociopathy all four engender when there is no way to escape their grip. If the present is violent, the past is oppressive, exerting its force by a strange sort of osmosis. Fevers of the blood course invisibly and unabated until they break in fear, sex, rage, murder, castration—one might even say that the catalog of stock plot points matches the character list in brutal predictability. Yet even though all these familiar pieces are laid out on the page, they are put together in a way so inventive and unexpected that melodrama is turned into something not only meaningful, but almost majestic, transcending its material to create an imaginative space more like a film than a conventional novel.",

It took him a year and a half, during which he assumed different perspectives: He was a high-spirited young adventurer with a talent for making friends; he was a knowledgeable and insatiably curious student of history and culture; and he was a sharply observant eyewitness of the moods and circumstances that were leading Europe inexorably toward World War II. A Time of Gifts, which covers the initial stage of the journey—“from the Hook of Holland to the Middle Danube”—was the first installment; Between the Woods and the Water, which follows him from Prague to the Balkans, was the second.",

The first novel in the series, My Brilliant Friend, is devoted to the girls’ school days and teenage years. It begins with them playing with their dolls and ends—in cliff-hanging form—in the middle of Lila’s tumultuous wedding. The apprehensiveness of childhood—the uncanny allure of dark cellars, the liberating mischief of stone throwing or shouting in a tunnel—is perfectly drawn, as are the classroom rivalries of girls and boys that foreshadow relationships between them that will develop and transform as elementary learning is outweighed by the lure and luck of circumstance.\n",

Lenù needs Lila’s intrepid mind to help expand her own, and Lila needs Lenù to scout the wider world she lacks the confidence to explore, especially after their educational paths fork and Lenù goes on to secondary school, university, and literary life. The Story of a New Name reveals what transpires as the two women grow, go their separate ways, then reconvene their collaborative destiny.   ",

Characterizing with fidelity the envies and jealousies that color, and sometimes corrupt, our lasting affections, Ferrante’s quartet, which continues in Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay, portrays the inherent conspiracy of two women aligned by consent and contingency against the powers that be.",

As Ferrante knows and as Lenù learns in the course of the lifetime she chronicles, being born in that Neapolitan neighborhood was a life sentence, unless you could learn to compose another to lead you out of its endless getting and wanting, the stultifying solace and demand of love, family, fate. So these books are about friendship, yes, but they are also about the never-solved riddle of how one can rescue a self from the primacies of raw experience, especially experience as vehement and violent as that which Lenù and Lila were born into. The entire saga—filled with melodramatic changes of fortune, amorous and political engagements and retrenchments, the humblings and humiliations of yearnings unfulfilled, conveniences yielded to—has been hailed as a singularly intense and encompassing story of friendship between women. It is surely that, and more, for Ferrante’s story turns on how her protagonists must confront not just the defining realities of gender but also summon the unscripted responses to family and community, to culture and society, to making a living and forging an identity that all of us are called upon to make, and from which many of us shrink.",

Having upended Pamela, so to speak, Fielding set out to write a novel that was truer to real life, with a hero who, though undeniably good at heart, is also a high-spirited young man with lusty appetites. One of the first great comic novels in English, and still one of the most entertaining in any language, Tom Jones is a gloriously robust and bawdy adventure boasting what Samuel Taylor Coleridge called “one of the most perfect plots ever planned.”",

The author spices his suspenseful plot with a beguiling, factual nostalgia that incorporates historical curiosities and actual events. A twentieth-century advertising illustrator named Simon Morley has found a way to travel back in time to do his sketching of 1880s New York on-site, so to speak. Under the aegis of a secret government project unfolding in late 1970, Si is immured in the famous Dakota apartment building overlooking Central Park; the furnishings are a replica of a Victorian domestic setting from a century earlier, providing a congenial environment for the self-hypnosis that will transport him into the past. What ensues is a tale of international espionage in the present, blackmail and murder in the past, and romance across temporal dimensions, one that carries the reader along for a heady, time-defying ride.",

But it is in its realization of that theme that the work’s true genius lies: Gatsby’s ultimately futile attempt to recapture his youthful passion for Daisy Buchanan makes almost palpable the present’s inability to live up to either past or future, and thereby catches the mood of our national life—and the contradictions of our national character, for which the American Dream never quite fulfills its promise—with poignant fidelity.",

Flaubert’s biting view of bourgeois enervation, polished by painstaking research and observation, is a lens of such power that it transforms a history of a historical epoch into an anatomy of social and psychological truths.

She lies constantly, spends other people’s money without reservation, and has little to no affection even for her own child. Yet by the novel’s end she has become so real that we can almost feel her presence, and her brutal end is not just tragic but heart-rending. How does Flaubert do it? Through an unprecedented act of close observation, one that has mesmerized generations of readers even as it revolutionized the novel as an art form. Before Flaubert, novelists were moralists or entertainers. The creator of Madame Bovary, by contrast, was an examiner, one with the objectivity and detachment of a forensic scientist; le mot juste is “scrutiny.”",

From Russia with Love, the fifth of Fleming’s Bond adventures, perfectly conveys the panache of his hero, who is blunt enough to blunder into danger but always sharp enough to find a way out. Taking place largely in Istanbul and on the Orient Express, it details a plot by SMERSH (the Soviet counterintelligence agency) to kill Bond as the first gambit in an elaborate scheme to discredit the British Secret Service at large.",

        "text": "Brazilian Adventure is a very funny account of a frankly ludicrous expedition for which, Peter Fleming notes, “Rider Haggard might have written the plot and Conrad designed the scenery.” Fleming and his companions march, fight, and canoe through three thousand miles of savage country in search of an English explorer, Colonel P. H. Fawcett, believed to be missing in the jungles of Central Brazil. But, as might be expected of a story whose initial section is titled “Through the Looking Glass,” everything here is somehow out of whack, and made even wackier by the portentous jungle setting.  Published in 1933, Fleming’s stylish and refreshingly original first book was distinguished by a self-deprecating sense of humor that was new to travel writing. The author, a rather unlikely explorer, delighted in his own improbableness and in the comic inconsequentiality of the poorly planned excursion. As Fleming’s biographer, Duff Hart-Davis, put it, “Until he came on the scene, travel and travel books had been treated with excessive reverence and solemnity; but then, with a single, sustained burst of self-mockery, Brazilian Adventure blew the whole genre sky-high.”",

But it is author Gillian Flynn’s knowing exploitation of the intimate pact between writer and reader, her head-turning violation of it, that tightens the story's grip on our attention. The workings of Flynn’s chilling novel turn on issues of faithfulness and trust, not only between husband and wife, but between author and audience. This last intimacy Flynn violates with such deviousness that she turns a standard thriller of love gone sour into a stunning psychological puzzle that seduces us in the way it’s told, and then is deepened by keen insight into the disappointments, duplicities, and distortions that derail speeding plots from the track toward happy endings.",

Although other writers may better illuminate the economic and political underpinnings of the war, Foote evokes its heroic and tragic dimensions on a scale no one else has approached. As a result, The Civil War: A Narrative is more than just a historical record; it earns a place alongside the most significant works of American literature.",

Ford’s artistry shows itself in the black comedy of Dowell’s narration, which appears at first to be meanderingly conversational and digressive but turns out to be as lethally well constructed as a ticking time bomb. Frequently cited as a “novelist’s novel” and as one of the great modernist works of the early part of the twentieth century, The Good Soldier was once described by a friend of Ford’s as “the finest French novel in the English language.”",

His story—engaging, well told, alive with his keen attention—is braided through the rich curriculum of techniques and processes that have made this an enlightening textbook for aspiring artisan bakers great and small. Yet the techniques and recipes are only the surface of a deep well of wisdom even a nonbaker will find profoundly meaningful, for what really distinguishes Forkish’s book is its generous transmission of the restorative power that comes from immersive understanding of any subject, craft, or skill.

Mrs. Moore has traveled to Chandrapore to visit her son, Ronny Heaslop, the city magistrate, in the company of Ronny’s intended, Adela Quested. The misalliance between East and West is deftly drawn by Forster as he overlays one comedy of manners (whose center is the English Club) upon another (revolving around Aziz and his Indian friends). The destructive rather than comic consequences of those differences suffuse the novel’s central event, an expedition to the local marvel, the Marabar Caves, organized by Dr. Aziz for the benefit of Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested. The outing ends in calamity, with Miss Quested racing from the scene to accuse Aziz of assaulting her in one of the caverns. The bewildering tenuousness of all personal relationships is Forster’s great subject; the urgency of the need expressed  in the epigraph to Howards End—“Only connect”—runs through the varied scenes of A Passage to India like the current of a slow but unstoppable river.",

The preparations of the Jackal—the killer’s code name—are enthralling in their relentless ruthlessness, and the investigative research and desperate energies of the detectives on his trail are equally absorbing. Forsyth’s work has spawned a tribe of imitators that is now in its second generation, but the original article has lost none of its appeal. The Day of the Jackal is the epitome of a page-turner.",

Animated throughout with brief humorous essays (try “Elegant Variation,” “Fused Participle,” “Novelty-Hunting,” or “Unequal Yokefellows”), Fowler's seven-hundred-odd pages are filled with delights, and his defanging of such beastly problems as Preposition at end and Split infinitive are not to be missed. In short, this most elegant, most essential of all English usage books will not only help you refine your writing, think more clearly, and bring you generally closer to heaven, but provide you with hours of entertaining reading as well.",

Yet it is told by a wry, erudite narrator who lets readers know he is writing exactly one hundred years later. In a tour de force of storytelling that is transporting, intriguing, and breathtaking in its shifting perspectives, Fowles combines suspense, romance, and invention into an emotionally satisfying and intellectually engaging whole. A master of a storytelling resourcefulness that always has us asking, “What happens next?,” Fowles here recasts the pleasures\nof the Victorian novel into modern literary dress in a way that only enhances their allure. To cap it off, he offers two endings, challenging the reader’s own ideas of romance, of the rights and wrongs of society’s whims, even of the nature of fiction itself.",

Encapsulating the terror of the Holocaust in the domestic drama of the Franks’ anxious existence and the private yearnings of the author’s adolescence, The Diary of a Young Girl puts a tender human face on the suffering of countless victims of Hitler’s regime. Although often referred to as “The Diary of Anne Frank” (the title used by the stage and screen adaptations), the book’s correct title, The Diary of a Young Girl, suggests one of the reasons for the book’s extraordinary effect on generations of readers: In the midst of terrifying circumstances, the author’s words are always alive with a recognizable teenager’s awkward mix of independence and vulnerability, silliness and soulfulness, honesty and wishful thinking, resentment and rebellion, guilt and responsibility.",

But just as the demeanor of Miles Franklin’s protagonist, Sybylla Melvyn, does not exhibit the demure discretion of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane, so her progress toward adulthood lacks the romantic resolution (in both senses of both words) that characterizes the story of her Victorian predecessor. Narrating her attempts to find a way out of her ramshackle existence, Sybylla pens sketches of family near and extended, and of misadventures both comic and disillusioning, that are drawn on a field of ambition colored with acute understanding of the limited roles available to women in her world. Franklin’s own commitment to composing a different life for herself, from a starting point very much like Sybylla’s, would lead to a career—several careers, in fact—of extraordinary adventurousness and accomplishment in America, England, and back again, ultimately, in Australia; her purposeful picaresque makes Jack Kerouac seem like a stay-at-home.",

A century after Hughes’s book, George MacDonald Fraser had the inspired idea of resurrecting “Flashy” and inventing for him a post-expulsion career. And what a gloriously deplorable career it has turned out to be! In a series of twelve hugely entertaining historical novels, Sir Harry Paget Flashman shows himself to be a cowardly soldier, a lecherous rogue, an unmitigated scoundrel—and, to the delight of countless readers, one of the great comic characters of modern fiction. Flashman is the first book in the romping series. It is narrated, as are all the installments, by the dastardly blackguard himself; novelist Fraser professes to act merely as the editor of “the Flashman papers”—bawdy, action-packed memoirs in which Flashy recounts his globetrotting life from the late 1830s to the early years of the twentieth century.",

The book, like the characters who people it, is high-spirited and funny, alive with Tom Frayn’s exuberant embrace of life, even in adversity, and with the extended eccentricities that are the through-line of any family’s narrative. It is poignant as well as humorous, filled with surprises engendered by the younger Frayn’s scrutiny of a past he’s never really set his mind to. As his warmhearted reminiscences approach their conclusion, the author realizes the homeliest of truths: We’re not—most of us, at least—heroes of literature or history, but merely figures going around on the repetitive and lulling carousel of day-to-day living. And maybe our relationships of love and fidelity are, when all is said and done, simpler than we think, less psychologically fraught than we are taught to fear, but present and sustaining nonetheless, even if difficult to find words for, as Frayn so lovingly does in My Father’s Fortune.",

Whatever the scientific merits of his psychoanalytic models —and they are hardly flawless—Freud largely invented the modern notion of the mind, and Western art and literature of the last century are almost unintelligible without him. He is also, unlike many major figures of German-language thought, a clear and accessible writer, and The Interpretation of Dreams is a pleasure to read. Detailing his consideration of the dreams of his patients as well as his own reveries, Freud develops his hugely influential theory of the unconscious, which gives primary importance to the libido, or the animalistic sexual energy that drives our inner lives. The Interpretation of Dreams also introduces the idea of the Oedipus complex. All of his writings, to the uninitiated, are surprisingly vivid and literary, filled with the exhilarating struggle of putting the most intimate secrets into words.",

        "text": "When asked, in 1957, to conduct a survey of her Smith College classmates on the fifteenth anniversary of their graduation, Betty Friedan noted in their responses the recurrent dissatisfaction with where they found themselves. Why were so many American women of her time and class unhappy? In The Feminine Mystique, Friedan is especially good in her analysis of the controlling forces of the ideals of femininity and domesticity she sees as dispiriting to women of her own generation: the advertising gurus glorifying the virtues of housework and housewifery; the unnatural psychosexual patrimony of Sigmund Freud; the male editors of “women’s” magazines; the quiet conspiracy of educators bent on keeping female students cordoned off from the more liberating and egalitarian precincts of learning and professional advancement. Bearing personal as well as historical witness to the struggle to claim equal rights and opportunities, Friedan’s book was a catalyst for the women’s movement of the 1960s and beyond, and remains—despite its now remote frames of reference and citation—a striking, noble, and relevant call to attention.",

The main character is Wyatt Gwyon (although in this slippery narrative, he will appear under other names as well), whose talent as a painter deflects him from following his father’s path into the ministry. Forsaking New England for Europe, he discovers a gift for making copies of Renaissance masterpieces—as well as “new” originals from the same period. As the book’s intricate plot unfolds, Gwyon’s skills as a forger are exploited by shady art world figures around the globe. Questions of faith and fraudulence, pretense and the search for authenticity shadow the moral progress (or more often failings) of several protagonists as the setting moves from Spain to Paris, Rome to New York City to Latin America. Gaddis has an unerring eye for the foibles and fatuities of both art and life, and his satirical invention is vivid, ebullient, and vastly entertaining, once you’ve come to recognize it.",

        "text": "One Hundred Years of Solitude is a novel so strange, so rich, so perfect in its singularity and timeless in its tenor, one can scarcely believe it was written as recently as 1967. At its start we are treated to an inkling of the author’s narrative conjuring: “Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Past, present, and future are entwined in what seems at first a simple opening sentence, and the book’s persistent themes of memory, prophecy, and wonder are introduced in a manner so intriguing that we barely stop to notice because we’re eager to discover what’s to come. Although one can read the novel as a metaphorical history of Colombia, the author’s homeland, or as a more far-reaching fable of the forces of inexorable decay that fuel nature and overcome civilizations—and it is, decidedly, both—the more fundamental spirit of the book engages the perplexities of time and memory on a human scale.

Although the book is labeled a novel, the connection between the characters and situations the book describes mirrors real events in Garner’s life, calling into question the nature of its fiction (to the consternation of several critics when The Spare Room was published). Regardless, the frankness of the telling is revelatory: Helen’s impatience with Nicola’s faith in the quack course of treatment that has brought her from Sydney, Nicola’s indulgence of her own desperation, and the harsh realities of disease, friendship, and looming mortality are rendered with striking candor, whether the emotion of the moment be anger or tenderness.",

While the town and tale at the center of this book are dominated by widows and single ladies—notably the spinster Jenkyns sisters, Deborah and Matty—the social roles that animate the interactions between characters are dependent, ultimately, on the legacies of fathers and husbands. Gaskell’s alertness to the ramifications of station and advantage, or their lack, does nothing to dim the bright charms of the community she depicts. Her narrative of visits, card games, snobberies, and mutual support in times of need makes Cranford a pleasant literary destination. ",

The complex tale is wrapped in the fortunes of the eleven-year-old orphan, Rajkumar, whom we meet on the first page and accompany through his long journey from poverty to wealth via the teak and rubber industries, and in the fate of his descendants. Replete with richly drawn characters and thoroughly imagined incidents, the novel encompasses courtly intrigue, colonial violence, economic adventurism and transformation, and questions of social and national identity, yet remains at its heart a saga of love at first sight—a love strong enough to cross years and borders.",

        "text": "“Another damned, thick, square book! Always scribble, scribble, scribble! Eh! Mr. Gibbon?” So, reportedly, spoke the Duke of Gloucester when Edward Gibbon presented him with the second volume of his enormous History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Thick and square defines all six of the history’s eventual volumes, each of which is filled with the scholarship, intelligence, and fine style that characterizes this most majestic of English language scribblers. Gibbon’s reach, in detailing the empire’s decline from AD 180 to the fall of Constantinople in 1453, is ambitious; yet his grasp of the vast sweep of events and culture is so sure, his prose so glorious, his store of primary sources so rich, that we are treated to the satisfactions of a deeply pleasurable read. Indeed, although there is much compelling intelligence in Gibbon’s argument that the degradation of civic virtue sealed Rome’s slow but sure fate (to say nothing of his somewhat scandalous judgment of Christianity’s pernicious influence in taking the Roman eye off the incentive of the here-and-now and directing its gaze toward the hereafter), it is the author’s literary facility that continually rewards and astonishes the reader. From the moderation of Augustus to the immodesties of Nero, from the advent of the saints to the invasions of Attila, from the foundation of Constantinople to the conquests of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, Gibbon covers an extraordinary expanse of human experience in this exacting work, which remains unmatched in both extent and eloquence. J. B. Bury’s multi-volume complete edition, with useful commentaries, is standard. The well-executed Penguin abridgment is an excellent one-volume alternative.",

She’s a marketing whiz, a high-flying “cool hunter.” (Gibson’s ear for contemporary talk, from multinational branding jive to the hacker poetry of cyberspeak, is pitch-perfect.) She is also obsessed with “the footage,” snippets of mysterious video being released periodically on the internet. When Cayce is hired to find out who makes the clips, she discovers that web links can form an old-fashioned web of intrigue, including a 9/11 subplot. Ultimately, what’s most memorable about Pattern Recognition is its detailed rendering of the profound disorientations of today’s connected culture: In the vast placelessness of an urgently mobile universe, everyone can reach everyone else instantly, but nobody really knows where anybody is.",

        "text": "In this eloquent volume, Gibson, a celebrated playwright (author, most notably, of The Miracle Worker), relates, with affection, anguish, wonder, and extraordinary sympathy, the story of his father and mother: their families and their courtship, their determined yet unspectacular search for economic security and domestic comfort in and around New York City in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, their dedicated parenthood, their illnesses and deaths. It is the story as well of the author’s own growth from boy to man, from happy child to disaffected youth to fledgling writer to father and—as his parents reached the end of their lives—once again blessed and reverent son. Beginning with a meditation on a missal he finds among his late mother’s effects, Gibson shapes his chronicle to the outline of a requiem mass, interspersing his continuous narrative with passages of evocative contemplation. In doing so, he fashions a language lofty enough to honor the generosity of life’s generations, yet supple enough to capture all the commonplaces—of parents and children, affection and argument, birth, marriage, death—that those generations inhabit. Happy families may be all alike, as Tolstoy asserted, but true and good books about them are rare. This is one of the very best, vivid with candor, sentiment, and faithfulness, and graced with a magnanimity that has made it fiercely loved by a small circle of knowing readers. ",

She forces us to consider whether we have first formed, and then kept, faith with anything larger than the immediate demands of our day-to-day existence.",

Faust consumed Goethe for most of his life. He started on it when he was still a student, and would go on to publish fragments and revise the texts for the next half century. Its reputation, not to mention its length, may be off-putting, but don’t be discouraged from at least tackling part one, the more accessible and exciting portion, which stands on its own as a complete play (many English-language editions contain only the first half). You might think of part two as a bonus for the afterlife. ",

        "text": "Every young person who’s written despairing romantic poems or a melodramatic diary, or even wallowed in the sadness of songs of unrequited love, has an ancestor in Werther, Goethe’s first consequential literary creation. The book in which he appears is for the most part an epistolary novel, consisting of letters from the lovesick title character to a friend who never appears. As a result, reading it is a kind of eavesdropping, as Werther shares his activities, conversations, and reflections with an intimacy of tone and an effusion of feeling that are peculiarly engaging despite the extent of his self-absorption. Traveling from the city to a small town to take care of a family inheritance, Werther grows to like the simplicity and quaintness of country life. But he falls madly in love with a local girl, Charlotte, who admires him but is already engaged. Both Charlotte and her fiancé (later husband) treat Werther with the greatest kindness, but Werther cannot contain his feelings, and spirals into suicidal depression. The end isn’t pretty. Although Goethe’s later work—the novel Elective Affinities, the poetry, and especially Faust—may be more elegant, Werther retains across the centuries all the passion and sentiment that made it so explosive in the Age of Enlightenment.",

Indeed, Italian Journey may be the most personable and immediately engaging of all his works, and is the perfect place for a reader to make his acquaintance. In its pages, we accompany Goethe as he escapes the habits and demands of his official responsibilities and public renown in Germany, where, in addition to his literary fame, he was prominent as a member of the inner circle and administrative government of the Duke of Saxe-Weimer, Karl August.",

Proceeding from an outrageous comic premise, Dead Souls hastens through the Russian landscape with demoniacal energy, its author probing provincial life with keen observations of character and custom even as he explodes the boundaries of realism with fantastical impressions and inventions. Gogol’s protagonist is Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, a swindler who moves through the countryside working an ingenious scam. Landowners of the time could buy and sell the serfs who worked their estates; these peasants were known as “souls,” and the landowners paid a government tax on each of them. When a peasant died, however, the tax still had to be paid until the next census—the soul remained on the books. Chichikov’s ghoulish scheme is to buy these “dead souls” and, while they remained in bookkeeping limbo, mortgage them as if they were live chattel. Through it all, Gogol’s eye for human folly never fails, and it is that alertness that gives the book its outsize animation.",

Although the book’s satire of Russian nobility is trenchant and funny, the author knows that his protagonist suffers from something more insidious than mere laziness, for Oblomov isn’t empty or corrupt: He’s intelligent, perceptive, and capable of deep friendship and passionate attachments. Indeed, the psychological inertia that Goncharov depicts, which seems to be strangely fostered by the very talents and advantages Oblomov possesses, retains its relevance today, and not just in terms of “couch potatoes.”",

        "text": "One might say that Edmond and Jules de Goncourt shaped the model of the modern man of letters: By dint of informed taste and obsessively self-studied sensibilities, they—by their own lights, at least—rose above the trivialities of the bourgeois world to dwell in a state of intermittent inspiration and perpetual ennui. Their high-minded artistic ambition as determined, if unsuccessful, novelists was matched to a worldly predilection for decadent pursuits, and their Journal is a kind of conversational companion to the highly wrought soliloquies of Charles Baudelaire. As addictive to readers as they clearly were to their writers, the journal entries attempt to capture what Jules described as “all the interesting things which are lost in conversation.” To an astonishing degree, they succeed; if Paris was the capital of the nineteenth century, the Goncourts were its devilish recording angels.",

        "text": "Dr. Frank González-Crussi is a pathologist who has composed several volumes of urbane and animated essays that do graceful justice to the lessons of mortality his medical work engages. While the morbid— in the exact sense—concerns of his profession lead him to explore such uncommon subjects as cadavers, coroners, and graveyards, his civilized perspective makes his writing, in the words of novelist John Banville, “a love letter to life, in all its strangeness, beauty and mystery.” His language is courtly and mannered, intricate and original, colored with nuance nourished by both clinical precision and the sometimes giddy exactitude of a wide vocabulary (nimiety and swank, murine and eclosion, muniment and vespertine). The doctor’s erudition and experience inhabit a larger range of reference and a richer cultural context than we are accustomed to in contemporary writing, and his sensibility—profoundly philosophical, witty and shrewd, compassionate—is built right into the sinews of his sentences. Prophesying the literary judgments of posterity is a fool’s game, but F. González-Crussi’s cultivated and idiosyncratic approach to exploring the substance of both life and death makes it easy to imagine future generations, ages hence, discovering his writing with welcome and wonder.

His interest in a specific curiosity never fails to illuminate some abiding principle of evolutionary theory. “Nature’s oddities are more than good stories,” he proves again and again. “They are material for probing the limits of interesting theories about life’s history and meaning.”",

What’s striking is not the emotional or confessional nature of any of her narrative—except for the number of occasions she admits to being unready for some crisis or responsibility thrust upon her, Graham is a straightforward rather than a reflective storyteller—but rather the quietly subversive way she must overturn her own assumption that she lacks the agency to choose the right path forward. Yet choose it she nearly invariably does, coaxing herself onto a wider stage and steeling herself to circumstances, like the heroine of a novel confronted with things she thinks beyond her ken but decides she must face up to nonetheless.",

The story of life on the riverbank is peopled with a cast of players—Rat and Mole, the formidable Badger, the ebullient, alluringly incorrigible Toad—who move right into the family room of one’s imagination and take up residence as old friends. While Toad’s antic escapades with caravan and motorcar provide comedy and excitement, the quirks and qualities of his fellow characters prove to be every bit as charming and memorable. No childhood should pass without a trip down Grahame’s river, or a walk through his Wild Wood. As for adults, they should never stray from these haunts for very long, for The Wind in the Willows is one of the archetypal works of English literature: In no other book are the quiet motives of the soul—comfort and friendship, wonder, the grace of nature and the ideal of home—so magically realized.",

Anything but innocent, this childlike figure who can, and frequently does, shatter glass with his voice, is the most unreliable of narrators, rendering the experience of Germans before, during, and after the Second World War as a kind of Brothers Grimm story in which both “once upon a time” and “happily ever after” have disappeared; what’s left is an intimate pageant of primal emotions, grotesque characters, and bizarre incidents that enchant the reader’s imagination with a kind of wicked glee. Like the most indelible fairy tale, Grass’s masterpiece leaves images rooting around in our minds that are ominous and enduring, fraught with a meaning we can neither evade nor explain.",

For all of them, the savagery of combat, the terrors of the trenches, and the absurdities of military bureaucracy meant “good-bye” to youth, innocence, idealism, even patriotism—good-bye, in short, to their seemingly immutable prewar way of life.",

Covering a period that runs roughly from the 1930s through the 1950s, The Dead of the House is narrated by a woman of the author’s age and background. Through the three parts of her tale, in which she progresses from childhood through adolescence into adulthood, Vanessa climbs a family tree as enchanted as a forest, its deep roots entwining the present in all the entanglements of the past. But The Dead of the House is by no means a conventional family saga; it’s more like a book of poems in which meanings are glimpsed rather than grasped, and in which recollection is recast as reverie. Green’s unforgettable book is a telling evocation of how we are shaped by our inheritance, bound to our dead by those qualities bestowed on us “by the strange accidents of time, of blood, of love.”",

Knowing he risks execution by carrying the sacraments from village to village and nourishing as best he can the spiritual needs of the poor, he struggles to uphold the vision of a God who both eludes and exhilarates him. Damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t, the whisky priest is a hero who, in his very unfitness for the role, reveals the imaginative nobility of faith, hope, and love even in—especially in—the most unexalted settings.",

Arriving to discover that his friend has apparently been killed in a traffic accident, Martins is troubled by police allegations of Lime’s sordid criminality and by his own growing suspicion that the “accident” may have really been murder. Cleverly upsetting one expectation after another for both Martins and the reader, Greene fashions a roaring good tale set in the shadowy underworld of Vienna’s postwar political intrigue—and in the equally murky precincts of his own devilish morality.",

Generations of storytellers have used these implements to widely differing purpose and effect, yet few have been such worthy craftsmen as the brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm: Their tales hew hidden forests of psychology into cupboards of compact narrative, each one a Pandora’s box of fateful apprehensions. Except for the Bible, it’s hard to imagine a book so rooted in our collective subconscious as the Grimms’ Children’s and Household Tales, the first edition of which, containing eighty-six tales, was issued in 1812 (the last, containing more than two hundred, appeared in 1857). Trained as philologists and lexicographers, the Grimms collected the tales they would retell with both passion and professional precision, fashioning an understanding of how popular culture shaped national identity as well as instituting methods of collection and organization that would provide the foundation for the future field of folklore studies.",

John Grisham has made a career creating plots that deliver just such pleasure to readers. In his writing, Grisham clearly knows how to enjoy himself, as the crime fiction columnist in the New York Times noticed early in his career, flagging the “relish” with which he writes about the deadly and devious antics of the Memphis law partnership of Bendini, Lambert & Locke in The Firm, his second novel. No matter how dark—or even far-fetched—the misdeeds Grisham has described in his shelf of legal thrillers, his vivid sketches of settings and personalities are made addictively entertaining as the writer’s relish becomes the reader’s. The Firm relates the education of Harvard Law-minted first-year associate Mitch McDeere while he uncovers—and scrambles to escape—the Mob-entangled web of malfeasance at the heart of B, L & L.\n\n",

As in Tolstoy’s War and Peace, not just the life of the nation but the life of larger, border-crossing historical cataclysms are reflected through the experience of one family—the Shaposhnikovs and its extended circle of friends, relations, lovers, colleagues. Dozens of characters enact tales of love and conflict, fidelity and infidelity, courage and cowardice, brutality and tenderness. The great theme of the book, surprising in such an enormously imagined work, is the particularity of individual experience and the difficulty of possessing it in both a totalitarian state and in the individual-erasing shadows of history. But, for Grossman, those shadows never erase the responsibility of each of us to try to find a spark of goodness to guide us. ",

Time and the Art of Living lends itself to slow, bit-by-bit, never-ending reading.

An international bestseller in the 1950s, Guareschi’s fiction—illustrated with his own charming drawings—captures human nature at its most petty, most generous, most stubborn, and most tender.",

This bold plan involved the dropping of some thirty thousand Allied paratroopers behind enemy lines in hopes of capturing the eight bridges that crossed the rivers and canals on the Dutch-German border. I Was a Stranger plunges readers into the thick of Arnhem’s unfolding catastrophe. Brigadier John Hackett is in command of the Fourth Parachute Brigade, which will be practically wiped out in the course of the fighting. He suffers nearly fatal wounds and then finds himself in a hospital being abandoned to the Germans by the retreating English and American forces. After his life is saved by what, under the circumstances, is miraculously expert surgery, Hackett is spirited out of the sick bay by the Dutch resistance movement, which is valiantly helping scores of trapped Allied soldiers elude the Nazis.",

Characters who impressed him indelibly in his boyhood are recalled with both candor and tenderness, the small dramas of their lives drawn with rueful understanding. What a beautiful book this is.",

But his mind is wandering, and in his heart he’s wondering about the cost of the drinking life he’s led. Staring into his vodka and tonic, he tells himself, “I’m never going to do this again.” This is not a book about drinking, but about growing up—about braving the clash between the camaraderie and comfort of the neighborhood and the exhilarating, terrifying loneliness of a wider world.",

        "text": "Dashiell Hammett is largely credited with the invention of the modern hard-boiled detective novel, wherein a crime is a crime, rather than a peripheral plot device, and a private detective is a tough-talking guy who solves it for cash. The Maltese Falcon is Hammett’s best work, not least because its protagonist is the now-archetypal private eye, Sam Spade. Hired by a femme fatale under false pretenses—Brigid O’Shaughnessy initially claims to be a Miss Wonderly, searching for her missing sister—Spade eventually learns that what she’s really after is a precious statuette of a falcon, said to be gold and jewel encrusted under its nondescript surface. By the time he discovers this, however, his partner, Archer, and the man Archer was tailing at Miss Wonderly’s behest are both dead, and Spade is suspected of killing them.",

That simple description gives no hint of the passionate gift this book gives its reader: a telling glimpse at how our hearts and minds make homes for themselves in this homesick world. By turns poetic, reflective, narrative, and journalistic, Hampl’s pursuit of private destiny finds in Prague a liberating dimension that most memoirs lack. The voice that conveys it, while always talking intimately to us, echoes with experience larger and deeper than its own, and thereby achieves a beauty and eloquence as rare as the understanding it communicates.",

The novel’s unnamed narrator introduces Oslo—or Kristiania, as it was called before Norway won its independence from Sweden—as “that strange city no one escapes from until it has left its mark on him.” For him, it’s a place of neither natural beauty nor cultural sophistication: It’s a capital of alienation, where an artist can starve while thousands of city dwellers shuffle past.",

The writing itself—constricted in its focus, matter-of-fact in its depiction of the author’s emotional uncertainty and his inability to elevate the unfulfilling facts of his mother’s existence—seems grief stricken, as if the words must be pulled by force of will and duty through the wearying weight of sorrow. Handke’s dolefulness and restraint result in a remarkable “act of piety,” as critic Michael Wood has perfectly described it, “an expression of respect: this woman’s bleak life is not to be made into ‘literature.’” What it is made into, for all of Handke’s reticence, is a probing, poignant expression of sympathy, desolation, and the limits of both words and love.",

Doel of Marks & Co. to disclose his name, more than two years for him to venture “Dear Helene,” and five more to begin matching her sarcasm. But long before that, friendship has blossomed. Although Hanff’s love for books informs the entire twenty-year correspondence, it’s her outrageous humor, especially when contrasted with Doel’s proper manner, that makes the exchange priceless.",

Reportorial vignettes, letters home, journal entries, character portraits, ruminations, and aphorisms follow upon one another across concentrated paragraphs that give Hardwick’s two hundred pages the feel of a much longer book.",

The heart of the book is Jude’s relationship with an independent-minded cousin, Sue Bridehead, with whom he makes a home and has children despite the fact that both are married to other people. Tragic consequences ensue, as if their love, like Jude’s hunger for learning, is fated to be met with punishment, no matter the nobility of spirit that impels it.",

He is perverse, polite, charming, brilliant, and brutal, and the FBI would like to lure him into helping with an ongoing investigation of a string of savage killings of young women that have left them baffled. Armed with a questionnaire and the protection of a file folder, Agent Clarice Starling comes face-to-face with the cannibalistic murderer, who is serving nine consecutive life sentences in a mental institution. So the forces of social order meet the urges of the sociopath; one side of that equation, as the reader soon recognizes, is seriously underprepared. Twisted minds, tortured bodies, and a straight line of perfectly pitched suspense add real horror to Thomas Harris’s novel, yet it is the riveting allure of Hannibal Lecter, the singular character at its core, that puts it in a class of its own as a modern thriller.",

Into the woods we’ve gone, from earliest antiquity, to seek enchantment, terror, or our gods, to lose and find our way; out of the woods we’ve come to make homes, villages, cities, and institutions. Knotty with ideas but gracefully composed, this book s is strewn with wonders, for even at its most arcane, Harrison’s learning is always revealing unexpected yet recognizable truths (you’ll never consider a wall, for instance, in quite the same way again). Through his own dense grove of allusion, reference, and intuition, the author illuminates this natural influence that has informed our inner lives, shaping our psyches at the same time as it has helped determine our understanding of religion, law, family, and more. Tying modern ecological concerns to the most ancient faiths and fears, Harrison has composed a work of scholarship that is at root about what it means to be human.",

And although this autobiography, published two years before his death, covers less than half of his short and thrilling life, it is as rich and satisfying as any reader could wish. Act One begins with the future impresario’s first glimpse of Broadway, at age twelve, as he is running an errand for the owner of the Bronx music store that employed him. It ends fourteen years later with his first triumph on the Great White Way: the 1930 opening of Once in a Lifetime, his initial collaboration with George S. Kaufman. The four-hundred-odd intervening pages provide ample evidence of Hart’s unerring knack for holding an audience spellbound. From the exuberant abandon of creativity to the intricate exigency of mounting a production, from the thrill of performance to the intoxication of acclaim, the reader experiences the joyful allure of the theater in the context of one young man’s coming-of-age.",

Let the simple and unsettling domestic horror story called “Wakefield” serve as an emblem for the rest. The plot couldn’t be simpler: A man walks out of his house one day and never returns, only to take up residence around the corner, where he resides for twenty years on the periphery of his previous existence. He offers no word of explanation—indeed, extends no communication at all—to his wife, whose haunted days the reader observes, as it were, through her parlor window. ",

        "text": "The story, at least in outline, is probably familiar. Its setting is seventeenth-century Boston, during the Puritan era. Hester Prynne wears the scarlet “A” that marks her as an adulteress. While she thus pays openly for her sin, the “godly” Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale endures the torments of a guilty conscience: His identity as Hester’s lover and the father of her child, Pearl, remains secret. Hester’s own sensibility, streaked with independence, nourishes an inner life that grows strong enough to lift the veil of guilt others have imposed upon it. She embodies a presence and purpose that make her one of the most vivid heroines in American literature (and a fitting counterpart to her fictional contemporaries Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, who startled English fiction about the same time as Hester appeared in print). The rich and evolving psychology with which Hawthorne imbues Hester exposes the Puritan dichotomy of good and evil as too simple to engage the real equations of human feeling that add up to a life.",

She knew that the conversation that takes place between animals and effective trainers demands sensitivity and imagination on both sides, but that its true character goes against the grain of the prevalent behaviorist theories, which reduce animal lives to a calculus of rewards and punishments. Enlivened with the practical knowledge her experience as a trainer of dogs and horses has brought her, and illuminated by her wide reading in philosophy and literature, Hearne’s pages are alive with an exhilarating intellectual energy. Hearne’s pages are alive with an exhilarating intellectual energy. They bring T. S.

Lying awake that night, he was struck by an idea, and a quintessentially American idea it was: “A man who couldn’t make things go right could at least go.” A month later, off he went, embarking upon a journey along the back roads of the United States, the two-lane highways marked in blue on old road maps. Deciding to travel in a circle instead of a straight line (to provide himself the promise of coming round again), Heat-Moon left his native Missouri for a three-month, thirteen-thousand-mile journey “in search of places where change did not mean ruin.” Pick up Blue Highways when you have the urge to read and nothing particular on the top of your list: Before Heat-Moon hits Kentucky, you’ll be hooked and eager to relish his wanderings from Nameless, Tennessee, to Remote, Oregon, from Why, Arizona, to Whynot, Mississippi.",

Its narrator, Bob Slocum, is an office worker on the wearying escalator of a senseless though sometimes vicious corporate track; a husband whose marriage resides in a different dimension from his heart; a father terrified by the opacity, vulnerability, and willfulness of his children; an individual whose once eager innocence has been tarnished by the indefinable something that so surely happened to set him in his hopeless ways. Although Slocum’s narration embodies his banal life, Heller’s almost surreal focus on its very banality transforms it, by an astonishing act of literary sleight of hand, into something mesmerizing.",

Captain John Yossarian, the protagonist of Heller’s pioneering and influential satire, is “moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity” of the “spinning reasonableness” that Catch-22 expressed: “There was an elliptical precision about its perfect pairs of parts that was graceful and shocking, like good modern art.” From those parts Heller spins a novel of mordant originality, exposing the obscenity of war via a blackly comic machinery that is fueled by Yossarian’s attempts to escape its horror.",

It is composed of sixteen stories, each followed by a brief prose interlude—often a paragraph, never longer than a single page—labeled as a numbered “chapter.” The chapters—scenes of peril and desperation drawn from the battlefield, the bull ring, and the annals of American urban violence—act as a kind of visceral punctuation to the stories, giving an ominous historical context. The disciplined directness of Hemingway’s expression—the way each word seems chosen and set with care, the modulation of cadence, the telling use of quiet—informs a style of stunning alertness as he explores youth’s conversion from innocence to experience. Although the character of Nick Adams is not central to every tale, the course of his coming-of-age shapes the book’s development. We share his youth and his admiration for his doctor father, the confusions of his first romance, his friendships, the aftermath of his wartime ordeal, and his fragile determination to make a home for himself in a homeless world. All the while, the something out there that’s not fooling infiltrates the space between the lines to intensify the hues of Hemingway’s attention to life, love, and death. Despite—or perhaps because of—its often miniaturist scale, In Our Time may well be the truest expression of its author’s prodigious gifts.",

        "text": "Published in 1952, this novella was greeted with wide popular acclaim; it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and was the catalyst for the Swedish Academy’s bestowal of the Nobel Prize on Hemingway a year later. For all its knowing description of the tools and techniques of fishing, The Old Man and the Sea is a tall tale of sorts, chronicling an elderly Cuban fisherman’s epic contest—“communion” might be a more accurate word—with an enormous marlin. Across several days and nights, the weary but determined Santiago tracks the hooked creature, until he at last claims his catch, which is so big that it must be strapped to the side of his skiff, where it is inexorably attacked and eaten by sharks before the old man can get back to port. The book’s sturdy, stalwart, almost ancient eloquence is haunted with echoes of the sure but ineffable truths of tragedy: We sense some profound meaning, but we can’t quite put words to it.",

Herodotus’s account of the Persian Wars would alone justify his book’s classic status: It is through his narrative that generations upon generations have learned of the battles of Marathon (where the Greeks turned back Darius), Thermopylae (where Leonidas and a squadron of three hundred Spartans, knowing they would die, led the tiny force that deterred the advance of many thousand Persian troops), and Salamis (the naval battle in which the Greek fleet routed the invaders). As important as his other achievements are, his most significant is often the most overlooked: The mind of Herodotus was just about the first to wander the world in prose, and in his rambling, engagingly inquisitive narrative he discovers and refines this literary tool as one of literature’s essential instruments of invention and investigation. From the headwaters of his Histories flow not only long rivers of historical writing, but, ultimately, the deep waters of the novel, essay, and memoir as well.",

Herriot’s professional attention to the calves, horses, dogs, cats, and other creatures he treats is matched by an unassuming sensitivity to the quirks and charms of the people—by turns cranky, crusty, amiable, and tender—who bring the animals to him. Indeed, it is the human, community story that lifts Herriot’s episodic narratives into a special class that, despite its constant engagement with life, death, and other elemental matters, is among the most joyful and delightful volumes you will ever open.",

        "text": "Born the illegitimate son of a wealthy Russian landowner in 1812, Alexander Herzen would play a significant role in fanning the flames of revolutionary thinking that spread throughout Europe in the nineteenth century. Despite his illegitimacy, he led a privileged childhood and was the beneficiary of both a fine education and a generous inheritance; nevertheless, he grew up preoccupied not with wealth and the nobility, but with poverty and the disparities of class. My Past and Thoughts is one of the most eloquent, humane, and compelling memoirs ever written. Each episode is animated by the author’s profound sensitivity to people and place, and the whole is imbued with a Tolstoyan magnanimity. The heading of the opening pages—“My Nurse and the Grand Armée”—exhibits the shifting perspectives that characterize the many chapters to follow, and Herzen’s portrayal of his father’s encounter with Napoleon gives an early example of his ability to deftly evoke the personalities of players upon the historical stage.",

Knecht's story—as well as the history of Castalia and its famous game—is related by a narrator whose solemn pedantry is at humorous odds with the high spirits of Hesse’s invention of a land that is the ultimate ivory tower.",

Through dozens of novels, beginning with The Black Moth, composed when the author was seventeen to amuse her sickly brother, Heyer deployed wit, invention, research, and an astute sense of human nature (and the way desire shifts and shapes it) to construct confections of plot and character distinguished by both satisfying storytelling and authentic historical flavor. An Infamous Army shows how, as in the novels of Patrick O’Brian and Bernard Cornwell, a gift for narrative entertainment can be enriched by the tang as well as the trappings of history. Beginning in Brussels in the weeks leading up to Waterloo, the story is choreographed—with a willful and flirtatious widow and an adjutant of the Duke of Wellington at the center—as a swirl of affections, scandalous behaviors, and secret assignations.",

Was Polynesia in fact settled by voyagers from the east, as Heyerdahl contended? Heyerdahl himself was always careful to claim no proof for his larger theory in the wake of the Kon-Tiki expedition; what his journey across the Pacific sought to establish, rather, was the possibility that balsa rafts constructed by Stone Age seafarers could have weathered the trip. In dramatizing that possibility through 101 days of difficult, dangerous, and exhilarating journeying, the author and his colleagues won the hearts and minds of countless readers.",

        "text": "In the spring of 1854, what the Times of London proudly called “the finest army that has ever left these shores” set out from England to wage war against Russia. Within a comparative blink of an eye, that splendid army was in shambles, mired in the horrific campaign now known as the Crimean War and “violently awakened from a dream of past glory into a modern world where heroism was not enough.” At the center of all this chaos presided the British commander in chief, Lord Raglan, who had survived the loss of his right arm at the Battle of Waterloo. As recounted movingly by Christopher Hibbert, the stages of the British army’s disintegration in the Crimea make painful, riveting reading. Hibbert shapes his spellbinding narrative around the tragic fate of Raglan, who, though vilified by many as an aloof ditherer, is in Hibbert’s view a grossly maligned figure. With the shattering story of the charge as its emotional focal point, The Destruction of Lord Raglan stands out as one of the most intensely affecting military histories of recent times. It is also one of the most mesmerizingly readable, and helps explain why its author was considered among the finest popular historians of his generation.",

He would go on to grace, in his dark way, four subsequent novels in the series known to Highsmith aficionados as the “Ripliad.” In The Talented Mr. Ripley, the twenty-five-year-old Ripley is an antihero awaiting his cue when fate arrives in the form of the wealthy father of Ripley’s college acquaintance, Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie has gone to Italy and—seduced by beauty of several kinds—won’t come home; the elder Greenleaf hires Ripley to persuade him. Introduced into a world of style, wealth, and sophistication, Ripley finds himself right at home in Dickie Greenleaf’s European life, and will stop at nothing to stay there. Ripley’s debut is quite simply one of the most engrossing novels you’ll ever find in any genre.",

Arthur Chipping—nicknamed Mr. Chips—has taught for most of his long life at a boarding school called Brookfield, ripening, as we learn in gently unfolding flashbacks, from an uncertain and undistinguished youthful instructor into a steady, benevolent presence in the lives of three generations of students. You can read it in the time it would take to drink a pot of tea, yet the warm sentiments in which it steeps you will linger long after you’ve closed its covers. Goodbye, Mr. Chips will certainly make you think fondly of the good teachers you’ve had, but there is more to the book’s sentimental pull.",

It’s a fairly safe bet that the work of few other authors covers the range—in audience, mood, invention, and substance—traversed by his creations. The Mouse and His Child is a third masterwork standing between the poles of the Frances books and Riddley Walker. The mice in question are toys. Hoban’s haunting, imaginative tale details their dangerous, often desperate exploits after they are sold and venture out into the cruel world and the treacherous, fearful territory of the resourceful Manny Rat. The Mouse and His Child is an eloquent,  breathtaking exploration of what it means to be alive on this earth. No kidding. It’s as powerful, as heartrending, and as memorable as any novel you’ll ever encounter.",

Hodges explores Turing’s thought in depth, placing his subject’s mathematical and historical achievements in context; he also tells Turing’s personal story with sensitivity and appropriate indignation.

GEB, as the author calls it, is not so much a ‘read’ as an experience, a total immersion into Hofstadter’s mind. It is a great place to be.”\nJohnson’s pleasure in Gödel, Escher, Bach is one that many readers have been surprised to share—surprised because GEB represents nearly eight hundred pages of elaborate argument, replete with philosophical dialogues, diagrams and illustrations, parts of musical scores, logic formulas, and other diversions, all speculating on the theme of how consciousness emerges from matter. Best of all, for all its intricacy and erudition, GEB is compelling, entertaining, and vital reading—a joyful book of boundless inspiration.",

According to the Calvinist doctrine of “unconditional election,” God chooses certain people to be saved—and because of their election, their actions are justified as the will of God. “To think that a justified person can do no wrong,” says the mother of Robert Wringhim, the justified sinner of James Hogg’s novel. “Who would not envy the liberty wherewith we are made free?” Imagine the narrative possibilities the idea affords. Hogg, a Scottish poet famous in his lifetime as the Ettrick Shepherd, certainly did. His strange and compelling 1824 book, combining elements of mystery thriller and Gothic horror story, psychological study and religious allegory, is a masterpiece of Scottish literature.",

Most famous as the creator of the image Under the Wave off Kanagawa, also known as The Great Wave, Katsushika Hokusai lived a long life fueled with protean energy, opportunistic alertness, and boundless artistry. When he began One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji in 1832, at the age of seventy-three, he had taken to signing his works “Old Man Mad About Drawing.” Hokusai’s study of Fuji’s enduring and implacable presence through the ephemeral activity of everyday living is a form of prayer, a book-bound pilgrimage across the expanses of time, space, and human busyness that the venerated volcano watches over and somehow blesses. The book is a strange, mysterious story as well; turning the pages from one image to the next, we are treated to a visionary, detailed, and often witty visual monologue on life, death, man, and nature by a wise, irreverent old genius whose extraordinary attention is a source of both inspiration and solace.",

His peerless, award-winning volumes on Percy Bysshe Shelley and Samuel Taylor Coleridge combine scholarly acumen with imaginative insight in a way that makes for riveting as well as informative reading. Holmes seems to have a natural respect for a reader’s curiosity, and his narrative gifts engage it every step of the way; it doesn’t hurt that his chosen subjects weren’t always well behaved, leading lives of notorious and fascinating variety. Footsteps is a different sort of work, a “mongrel book,” in the author’s characterization, “being part pure-bred biography, part travel, part autobiography, together with a bad dash of Baskerville Hound.” The whole is more than the sum of its parts, and entirely delightful. It would be too much to claim that the personality of the author is a match for the charisma of his subjects, yet it is Holmes’s own developing character—and his preternatural gift for weaving an engrossing tale from threads of information and intuition—that make this account of the making of a biographer an unforgettable literary excursion.",

Somewhat inexplicably, given the younger man’s evident probity, the two struck a bond of friendship, and spent many impoverished evenings together on long walks through London. Johnson seemed to invest their relationship with considerable private resonance, and was clearly under Savage’s spell, so much so that six months after the latter’s death, and some five years after their separation, he penned The Life of Mr. Richard Savage (1744). This composition, Johnson’s first significant work of prose, represented, as Richard Holmes convincingly argues, a new form of life-writing, shaped by their intimate night walks. Reconstructing Savage’s story by his own research, Holmes investigates how Johnson informed it with his emerging knowledge of human nature and emotion, revolutionizing biography and the romantic notion of the poet as well.",

Commencing when Justice Holmes was seventy-five and Laski only twenty-three, it continued until the older man’s death.",

Yet the sense of pageantry the poem evokes obscures what may be its most telling characteristic: the peculiar angle from which Homer chooses to view antiquity’s most fabled war, focusing on only a few weeks in a decade-long struggle. Throughout, The Iliad is filled with astonishing passages of martial valor (see the feats of the Greek warrior Great Ajax, and his engagements with Hector, in books 7, 14, and 15), divine invention (the fashioning of Achilles’s shield by Hephaestus in book 18), and magical inspiration (the scene, in book 19, in which Achilles’s horse foresees his destiny), but what are most stunning in the end are the scenes that unfold on a human scale.",

Two thousand years ago the Roman poet Horace had wisdom to dispense on each of these themes, and his sophisticated, elegant poems remain well worth pondering today. In these short poems, whose subjects are drawn from the poet’s reflections on the news of the day and his ordinary encounters, Horace brings his philosophical bent to bear on the older Greek models his poetic forms imitate and reinvent. In their combination of conversational address, verbal and aural intricacy, and profound thoughtfulness, the Horatian Odes represent the archetypal inspiration from which our tradition of lyric poetry descends.",

A wealth of research and detail is marshaled across nearly a thousand pages, but it is ordered with such formal elegance, and imparted in sentences and paragraphs shaped by such a musical measuring of language, that reading Horgan’s massive tome is spellbinding in an expansive, leisurely way: It’s as if we are being carried along on the tide of a capacious, vibrant, and event-filled historical symphony.",

Irreverent, impulsive, insightful, Hornby’s reader’s diary is pure pleasure.",

Set in Nazi-occupied Norway in March 1943, it begins with a four-man commando raid that goes spectacularly wrong and leaves all but one of the expatriate Norwegian resistance fighters dead or captured. The lone survivor is twenty-six-year-old Jan Baalsrud, and though he too has been seriously wounded, he manages to escape the ambush and takes off on an incredible trek into the wilds of the Lyngen Alps. David Howarth’s 1955 narrative is as singular as its modest hero—who, it should be noted, in later life always downplayed his own part in the story of his escape by asserting that “All I did was run away.”",

World of Our Fathers is Irving Howe’s monumental history of that great migration. A panoramic survey, it traces the migrants’ journey from their first steps out of the Old World, through the ordeal of an Atlantic crossing in steerage, to arrival at Ellis Island and entrance into the teeming life of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It then chronicles in rich detail the immigrant generation’s attempt to maintain its Yiddish culture while forging a uniquely Jewish-American way in the new society. Howe’s enormous erudition and keen intelligence are matched throughout by an obvious affection for the aspirations and experiences that shaped the culture that had nourished him, and to which his book is such an invaluable tribute.",

Britain’s unprecedented system of “convict transportation,” begun in the late 1700s, was to last for some eighty years, during which time more than 160,000 men, women, and children were shipped in bondage to Australia; it was “the largest forced exile of citizens at the behest of a European government in pre-modern history.” The incredible truth is that the British government had conceived the idea of turning the unexplored continent into a jail, a “thief colony.” No surprise then that Australia’s creation is a one-of-a-kind historical epic—and, in this truly monumental book, a one-of-a-kind historian has done it justice. Astutely attentive to the harsh realities of Australian transportation for prisoners and captors, Hughes is also alert to its profound effects on the Aboriginal population. His superb prose is equal parts eloquence, erudition, and stylistic electricity, and its powerful effects are amplified by the words of the convicts themselves, culled from letters, diaries, and other sources.",

        "text": "The product of two decades of literary labor, Les Misérables was begun while the author enjoyed political favor in Paris and finished during Hugo’s nineteen-year political exile in the Channel Islands. At the core of its vast narrative is Jean Valjean, a peasant imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s starving children. This rash act will haunt him through all the events that follow, for even though the noble Valjean can escape prison, he cannot escape his past, which relentlessly pursues him in the body of the implacable Inspector Javert. Hugo’s fierce advocacy for the poor and oppressed (the book’s title might be translated as “The Wretched” or “The Outcasts”) runs like an electric current through the intricate plot that leads readers from the countryside to the urban underworld, from the Battle of Waterloo to the Parisian sewers through which Valjean flees in one of the most famous episodes in all of fiction. Teeming with unforgettable characters—including the saintly bishop known as Monseigneur Bienvenu, the young and unfortunate seamstress Fantine, her orphaned daughter Cosette, the street urchin Gavroche, the villainous Thénardier, and the fiery revolutionary Marius—Les Misérables encompasses historical events, societal injustice, personal suffering and sacrifice, and love in all its hopes and heartaches.",

Yet dialect is only one of the literary registers Hurston employs in Their Eyes Were Watching God. The novel tells the story of Janie Crawford, a woman born in unfavorable circumstances whose grandmother wants her to have the chance at happiness she never had and that Janie’s mother also missed. Searching for love and fulfillment, Janie runs away from the husband her grandmother finds her, marries another man and then a third, named Tea Cake, with whom she at last discovers a satisfying relationship—until tragic and violent events destroy their peace. Janie’s instinctual sense of the self she inhabits—an identity that extends beyond the descriptive categories that might otherwise define her as an African American, a woman, or a wife—is vividly conveyed, imbuing the book with a spirit of affirmation that its heroine embodies throughout her tribulations.",

Reminiscent of Gulliver’s Travels, Huxley’s fiercely funny portrait of a civilization gone mad with manufactured happiness is ingeniously satiric, hilariously imaginative, and eerily prescient. Its unbridled invention makes it a most entertaining cautionary tale.",

The centrality of books to our idea of culture, the author asserts, was an epochal phenomenon, the beginning of which can be traced to “a technical breakthrough which took place around 1150, three hundred years before movable type came into use.” To illustrate his point, Illich, an Austrian philosopher and Catholic priest, tells the story of reading during that long-ago period of transition, and in so doing turns a profoundly scholarly work on an obscure medieval manuscript into an enlightening essay in ideas.",

It’s an apt summary of what has come before. The story of the novelist T. S. Garp and his mother, Jenny Fields, of Garp’s wife and their sons, of the transsexual former football player who becomes something of a bodyguard to Jenny when her autobiography thrusts her into the feminist limelight, and of sundry individuals and families who cross the paths and hearts of those just mentioned, The World According to Garp starts out hard to believe, quickly becomes hard to put down, and remains forever hard to forget.",

Set in Berlin in the early 1930s, the stories depict a desperately carefree world of decadence and fatalism in the shadow of looming Nazi violence. Adept at capturing the awful loneliness of licentiousness, Isherwood portrays a demimonde so intent on the pursuit of hedonism that it frantically evades any heroic impulses in the face of political brutality; but in this, of course, his characters were not alone.",

Stevens has been devoted to his career, playing a reliably unobtrusive role in polishing the etiquette of the upper class while pursuing—in action and, increasingly, in reflection—the goal of greatness in his profession. His dedication to duty is such that he has relegated his private emotions so far below stairs that he seems unable to retrieve any feelings at all. Nothing—not even his father’s dying—is allowed to interfere with his focus on his appointed rounds. The book is a masterpiece of exquisite irony, embroidered around an understanding of human frailty that the author insinuates onto every page, even while it eludes the grasp of the butler who tells the tale.",

It is funny, but subtle - the kind of funny that makes you guffaw under your breath instead of cackle out loud. But that is its genius. Jackson tells her story of motherhood in such an authentic simple fashion that it she brings out the drama, humor, and exasperation of the daily moments that almost escape our notice. But even more, as the book was written in the mid 29th century, the historical context of sexism is apparent. But Jackson also treats this is a nonchalant way, not preaching about what was or should of been, but just as cursory glimpses into that world.\n\nThe book is brilliant.\n\n",

Her wickedly disturbing passion play, enacted by the four (later, six) individuals gathered at the cursed mansion known as Hill House, perfectly equates the interior state of the spinsterish protagonist, Eleanor Vance, with the confusing, calamitous rooms and the surrounding acreage of the titular dwelling. Besides serving as a quietly horrifying testament to one woman’s disintegration, Jackson’s mordant 1959 book also brings a fresh sophistication to the horror genre through its characters’ recognition of what the plot will demand of them. By their conversation when they first meet, they make clear that they know they’re enacting clichéd roles from myriad films and novels. But their ultra-modern awareness fails to forestall the actual terror, and this is perhaps Jackson’s scariest assertion: The intellect is no real bulwark against the darkness.",

Just as important for readers, its author’s powers of perception are allied to considerable literary gifts, and so its pages are animated with descriptions of city life as vivid as any ever penned. Moreover, the book’s influence has extended far beyond the strictly urban beat, for Jacobs’s insights into the way cities work—from the uses of sidewalks to the nature and nurture of neighborhoods—have much to tell us about the way we live networked lives.

One of the revelations of this book is the way James persuasively suggests that certain elements of the British imperial legacy are the seeds from which his later commitment to social justice grew.",

The whole enterprise is an impassioned and—by dint of James’s glorious style—engaging defense of the reading life: “somewhere within the total field of human knowledge,” he writes, “humanism still beckons to us as our best reason for having minds at all.” This massive, sprawling, quirky exploration of one man’s humanistic vocation leaves us not only with a remarkable reading list, but with a thinking list as well. In its idiosyncratic way, it’s a book you can’t put down, and will never exhaust.",

All of James’s tales are ghost stories of a sort, the characters haunted by some absent person, unattainable ideal, or elusive memory that exerts an uncanny influence on their conduct, evoking a sense of menace that is distinctively his. In The Aspern Papers the ghost is the famous (and invented) poet Jeffrey Aspern and the ghost-hunter is the tale’s unnamed narrator, the devoted co-editor of Aspern’s work who has never had occasion to speak to a person who actually knew the poet. And the evocations of Venice are as good as any lovers of that city will ever come across: It’s a perfect setting indeed for a tale of obsession, heartbreak, and civilized horror.",

On the surface, The Portrait of a Lady is about an American ingenue who charts a singular path into the wider world only to find her singularity no match for that world’s designs and duplicities; at its depth, it’s about how intrepid solitude must become to help an individual maintain her identity under the onslaught of society’s charms and expectations.",

A mere three dozen stories constitute nearly all of James’s literary output, which he composed in his off-hours and often shared in Christmas readings to his students. No surprise, then, that a James story is just the thing for a winter’s evening read-aloud by a fireside, when the comfort of domestic security is challenged by the cozy threat of supernatural specters. No surprise, either, that the storytelling is invitingly uncomplicated, addressing the reader directly as it accumulates small, colorful digressions to establish a field of ordinariness that will be quietly transformed by the creeping sense of unexplained phenomena.",

        "text": "The book begins with a precision of time, place, and other coordinates—a police procedural, after all, being in essence a fatal novel of manners. An old woman and a young boy discover two dead bodies in a church. In life, the two men lying in the vestry, both with their throats slit, could hardly have been more different: One was a local vagrant, the other a baronet and a rising star in politics. In one of the most puzzling investigations of his long career, Commander Dalgliesh must unravel the twisted threads that yoked them together in death. As James details his investigations, the plot resonates with themes of faith and doubt that give unexpected dimensions to the question “What happens next?” Fellow crime novelist H. R. F. Keating, creator of the delightful Inspector Ghote, summed up James’s achievement in this book best when he wrote, “By entering the worlds and minds of all her main characters—suspects, investigators, bystanders—she has been able to say more about life than has hitherto been attempted in the crime form.”",

It’s hard to imagine a more uplifting bedside book than a volume of James’s correspondence, and this selection edited and introduced by Elizabeth Hardwick—perfect but for its lack of the “SUCCESS” letter to H. G. Wells quoted above—is the best one to start with.",

Jaynes posits that human consciousness was not inherent in animal evolution, but rather is a learned process, based on metaphorical language, that emerged roughly three thousand years ago in response to historical stresses and increasing social complexity. Consciousness, Jaynes asserts, grew out of an earlier mentality he calls the “bicameral” (two-chambered) mind, in which human beings experienced what were essentially auditory or verbal hallucinations that they interpreted as the voices of gods and that directed their actions. Whether or not you are convinced by the author’s arguments, his speculations are guaranteed to invigorate your thinking about thought, language, antiquity, and human nature.",

Drawn outside the stultifying social circle of her fellow British wives, Olivia falls in love with the rogue Nawab, a minor Indian prince, and secretly spends her days with him—until circumstances and a scandal threaten both her secret and her life.

        "text": "Samuel Johnson looms over the conventional history of English literature like a presiding judge, the man of letters par excellence. Poet, essayist, and editor, commentator and conversationalist, lexicographer and sage, Dr. Johnson lived by his pen and his wits, setting standards that both comprehended the qualities of our language and expanded its literary and expressive possibilities. And yet: No one work really comes close to carrying his stature, and modern readers might find themselves at a loss as to how to read him. It’s best to follow the lead of Johnson himself, who left school at the age of sixteen and, unable to afford university, spent the next few years in his father’s bookshop, plunging into dozens of books with a cursory but apprehensive eye, in vigorous pursuit of what Edmund Wilson once called “the miscellaneous learning of the bookstore, unorganized by any larger purpose, the undisciplined undirected curiosity of the indolent lover of reading.” In other words, pick up a sampler of Johnson’s work, and dip into it as the spirit moves you; McAdam and Milne’s A Johnson Reader is an excellent resource for this, containing several of his best essays, the prefaces to Shakespeare and the Dictionary (with selections therefrom), biographical writings, poetry, and letters. Your estimation of Johnson’s achievement—and your wonder at the relevance of his insights into life as well as literature—will grow with every paragraph you read.",

        "text": "At the age of eighteen, Pat Jordan signed his first professional baseball contract with the Milwaukee Braves. He seemed on the verge of a golden future: big-league success, cheering crowds, World Series rings. That future never unfolded. Jordan pitched three years in the minor leagues—“at towns like McCook, Davenport, Waycross, Eau Claire, and Palatka”—watching his dreams shrink as his control, and his career, floundered. Nonetheless, having moved on to marriage, fatherhood, college, teaching, and writing, Jordan remained defined by baseball, and a decade after he left the mound—still thinking of himself “not as a writer who once pitched, but as a pitcher who happens to be writing just now”—he penned a memoir that is filled with the lore of the game, the heat of competition, the camaraderie of the locker room, nostalgia and regret, bewilderment at time’s unhittable slow curves. In A False Spring, Jordan composed one of the best-written, truest memoirs you’ll ever read—not just about baseball, but about growing up as well.",

        "text": "Dubliners is one of the most admired collections of short stories in world literature. Published in 1914, it was Joyce’s first book of prose. Although the fifteen stories follow different characters through disparate situations, the collection’s overarching unity of theme and imagery shapes an experiential itinerary through childhood, young adulthood, maturity, and public life. Many of the stories hinge on an “epiphany,” a telltale moment of illumination that Joyce defined as “a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself.” Dubliners collectively relates events that take place in the city between 1894 and 1905. Although several of Joyce’s stories are recognized as masterpieces of the genre, “The Dead,” the book’s longest and its final tale, must be singled out as one of the finest works of  fiction in English; its concluding sentences concentrate the music and magic of our language into a breathtaking—and heartbreaking—spell. If you never read anything else by James Joyce, do not forsake “The Dead.”",

Snatches of story and song and smell (for even the highest flights of this author’s aesthetic fancy are rooted in common realities) are summoned to the page. In this elemental welter of sound and sense, Joyce suggests, a writer’s education begins. Stephen Dedalus is the writer in question, and the early portions of Joyce’s fiercely autobiographical coming-of-age novel show him growing up and then rebelling against his family, his country, and his religion, while never quite escaping his conflicted affection for each.",

        "text": "Ulysses is perhaps the most famously difficult of all modern novels. Its difficulty, however, doesn’t lie in the story it tells, which, in its essentials, is quite simple: The book recounts certain events, most of them not in the least extraordinary, that occur in Dublin on June 16, 1904. What does make Ulysses more difficult than most novels is the manner of its telling. The stylistic richness and bravura of Ulysses are both daunting and exhilarating, often in the same line. The concentration of Joyce’s powers makes each passage a treasure to be excavated, each page its own Troy. Beneath all the complexity, Dublin remains the Muse, if not the real hero, of Joyce’s epic. No other work of literature had ever set out to replicate—and celebrate—the noise of urban life with such alertness, art, spite, and glee. Capturing the city he loved and despaired of in all its hunks and colors, grime and glory, grievances and yearnings, Joyce created a literary metropolis that hums, moans, shouts, and sings with the collective music of the human comedy. There is no other book like it.",

Compared with his older colleague, Jung is a wilder and more difficult figure. His most broadly influential work, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, which was published posthumously, is an autobiography of sorts, grafting his work and life together in a single story. In this book we can look behind Jung’s psychological writings to see the man who struggled so fiercely to conceive them.",

Yet within their deceptive dimensions, they seem to move elemental psychological states—guilt, fear, unknowing—around a symbolic chessboard in a game whose rules we don’t quite understand, but whose stakes are clearly high. Although the stories can be read as a unit, several have gained fame on their own. The most famous of the stories, surely, is “The Metamorphosis,” an early effort; written in 1912, it’s among the few works Kafka saw published during his lifetime. In it, as in all of Kafka’s work, the incomprehensible and the absurd are taken at face value—as if to remind us that his bizarre inventions are not escapes from the world we live in, but cracked mirrors that reflect the fathomless depths that lurk behind the surfaces of everyday experience.",

The novel so captured the contemporary mind that the word “Kafkaesque” was coined—and gained currency far beyond the author’s readership—to describe situations that echo Josef K’s: hopeless struggles against obdurate or surreal bureaucracies, with no opportunity afforded the victim to escape the system.",

        "text": "“You may glory in a team triumphant, but you fall in love with a team in defeat,” Roger Kahn observes, reflecting on his own passionate attachment to the Brooklyn Dodgers. Kahn covered “dem Bums” as a sportswriter for the New York Herald Tribune during the summers of 1952 and 1953, in the middle of the team’s run of “Wait till next year” World Series defeats at the hands of the hated Yankees, their intracity rivals. The star of the team was second baseman Jackie Robinson, who only a few years earlier had become the first African American player in the major leagues. Other future Hall-of-Famers on the club were Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, and Duke Snider. The roster also included such Brooklyn paragons as Gil Hodges, Andy Pafko, Carl Furillo, Clem Labine, Carl Erskine, and cunning spitballer Preacher Roe. Kahn got to know them all, both on and off the field, in their playing days, then decided—to the good fortune of readers—to renew his acquaintance with them a couple of decades later. The Boys of Summer is a series of poignant and pleasurable encounters with middle-aged men battling, generally with grace and good humor, “the implacable enemy, time.”",

This marvelous book, written by a cook, is filled with the same sort of affection, nostalgia, and gratitude. In eight chapters, Madeleine Kamman celebrates the women (from her great-grandmother Marie-Charlotte to Magaly Fabre, matriarch of a wine domaine) from whom she received, and with whom she shared, the blessings of her vocation. Happily for the reader, each of the eight women profiled represents a different area of France, allowing Kamman to survey her native cuisine from Normandy to Provence. Although it is packed with recipes as rich with recollection and as fond of time and place as the photographs in a family album, Kamman’s personal testament is not only about food, but also about one woman’s respect for the culture that nurtured her.",

        "text": "By making a prison the focal point of his mammoth Civil War novel, MacKinlay Kantor sets his compassionate but unflinching appraisal of a bloody historical burden not in fields of glory, but in a morass of suffering that envelops soldiers of North and South alike. Andersonville festers with physical pain and emotional exhaustion: The torments of wounds, weather, and incarceration overwhelm inspirations of martial courage or even duty. This idiosyncratic epic is historical fiction on both a grand and a human scale; historian Bruce Catton called it “the best Civil War novel I have ever read,” and the superlative takes proper measure of Kantor’s achievement.",

        "text": "Mary Karr begins her gritty narrative on the violent night in 1961 when her mother, Charlie Marie Moore Karr, was carted away because she was “nervous” (read “crazy”). In the hardscrabble East Texas oil refinery town of Leechfield, Charlie had always stood out. She had “artist’s airs” about her, a hangover no doubt from her abortive escape to New York. She drank too much. Focusing on her own seventh and eighth years, Karr creates a world of child-eyed views that are deepened and colored by the before and after, by anecdotes of grandparents, and by her adult musings on the barren, sometimes cruel precincts of her upbringing. Mary Karr didn’t have a storybook childhood. As The Liars’ Club brings home, it was filled with unreliable adults and unpredictable but ever present furies. Nonetheless, and quite remarkably, it is truly and harshly beautiful, an exceptionally intense, honest, and quite funny coming-of-age tale, written in language that sings with indelible poetry.",

That writer was Yasunari Kawabata, who was honored for his “narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind.” Kawabata had made a name for himself with his spare, sensual, and impressionistic novels, most notably Snow Country (1948), Thousand Cranes (1949), and The Old Capital (1962). Yet the author felt that the essence of his art was contained in his short works, which he called tanagokoro no shousetsu, or “stories that fit into the palm of one’s hand.” Imbued with a melancholic eroticism, these tales distill beauty and sadness into their purest states as the lingering imprints of experience. Kawabata’s gift for capturing the lights and colors of the physical world illuminates every vignette.",

The story unfolds in the 1920s in a Greece under the thumb, and at the mercy, of its Turkish rulers. The residents of Lycovrissi, a relatively stable, even affluent village, are embarking on preparations for their Passion Play, a reenactment of the trial, suffering, and death of Jesus performed once every seven years. Roles are assigned, and the casting of the apostles, Mary Magdalen, and Judas as well as Jesus is spot on: The villagers fall naturally into their parts long before they take the stage. In its incarnation of transcendental themes, The Greek Passion entwines the power of gospel parable, the terror of ancient tragedy, and the social fidelity of the modern novel in a searing, singular way.",

This last culminates in an extended description of our world of pains and troubles as not a vale of tears, but rather a “vale of Soul-making”—a passage inspired enough to bring one’s entire life into new focus.

        "text": "“What is it like to be in a battle?” When this book was first published in 1976, it amazed readers by answering that question in a revelatory way. Traditional “battle pieces,” for example, with their stylized imagery and highly selective, discontinuous treatment of the fighting, described battles as if from above the fray, treating soldiers as mere pawns; similarly, the “decisive battle” school of military history was less interested in the personal ordeal of combat than in the big-picture mechanics and implications of victory or defeat. Keegan, by contrast, set out to look at three famous battles—Agincourt (1415), Waterloo (1815), and the Somme (1916)—through the eyes of the ordinary soldiers who fought in them. Combining sensitive reading of anecdotal and official histories with research into contemporary weaponry and analyses of strategic decisions, Keegan creates a vibrant and thoughtful portrait of men at war. Readers unfamiliar with but curious about the literature of war would be smart to take Keegan’s masterpiece as their entrée to this compelling genre.",

No doubt this youthful infatuation had something to do with finding a crime-solving role model, but one suspects there is more to it than that. Yes, the books are formulaic, so there’s no need to rehearse the details of Nancy Drew’s debut: Suffice it to say there’s a missing will, and various parties with different motives are invested in the revelation—or concealment—of the inheritance it holds. Nancy asserts herself, gets in and out of danger, and triumphs in the end, with some broader benefit to the community as well as her ego. She’s tough, with a bit of guile to boot, and readers root for her with the same kind of fervor and identification a fan affords a favorite athlete, or, for that matter, a budding historian might lavish on the young Napoleon or Marie Antoinette.",

The former, Helen Keller, lost her sight and hearing a few months before her second birthday; a few years later, the latter, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, an inexperienced teacher, twenty years old and half blind herself, traveled from Boston to Helen’s home in Tuscumbia, Alabama, to try to educate her. Keller was seven when Sullivan arrived, an unmanageable, incommunicative child, prone to tantrums and violent outbursts. Bestowing upon her charge via resolute discipline and relentless instruction the ability to interpret her sensory experience and, via imagination and analogy, translate it into language, Sullivan unlocked the mind and heart of a woman Winston Churchill would call “the greatest woman of our age.”",

Take the opening of the chapter in the book devoted to the strange affair of Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers, in which radical politics, loyalty, class, espionage, and fear combined to make not only controversial history but unresolvable drama as well: “The world of shabby gentility is like no other; its sacrifices have less logic, its standards are harsher, its relation to reality is dimmer than comfortable property or plain poverty can understand.” The joint portrait of Hiss and Chambers is one of the ten pieces that make up Part of Our Time, which the author describes as “a series of novellas that happen to be about real persons.” A reader’s interest in the era and its issues may be nil at the start, but Part of Our Time mines the past to explore not historical truths but human verities. It does so with such startling sagacity that you’ll close the book with an enlarged understanding of the guilt and glory that abide—whatever the politics of the moment—in what the author calls “the pilgrim soul of man.”",

The press was at the heart of the cultural coterie of Bloomsbury in the 1920s, and Kennedy’s episodic memories are filled with glimpses of the personalities of the Woolfs and their celebrated friends and familial and artistic relations. The book also details the hands-on nature of the Hogarth operation, from typesetting to press work, book sales to packing parcels. But, like many calamities that befall the young, those remembered here by the author—along with the skating parties, cricket matches, and intellectual pursuits that enlivened his Bloomsbury experience—are imbued with the fond amusement maturity affords the ungainly youth it has left behind. Artful, observant, affectionate, and wry, A Boy at the Hogarth Press is perfectly charming.",

Each page seemed to reassemble for the reader a portion of an elaborate mosaic that revealed the brilliance of an almost mythological constellation of writers. Kenner’s most striking revelations are about Ezra Pound, the figure he puts at the center of the creative generation that included James Joyce and T. S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis and William Carlos Williams, among many other contemporaries, not to mention (poetic time being the most figurative of media) Sappho and Homer, Dante and Li Po. A difficult book, but a seductive one, it presumes an interest in its protagonists, and even some knowledge of their achievements; yet, since its themes—the evolution of language, the engendering of images, the life of story—are seminal to the making of meaning, the reach of The Pound Era is wide and its resonance deep.",

Unable to fit in, too unknowing to avoid the vicious taunts of her classmates, Carrie takes what comfort she can in her peculiar telekinetic ability: By concentrating on objects, she can make them move. Yet even this distinction is sinful in her mother’s eyes, and her psychic faculties are suppressed—until an unexpected act of kindness leads Carrie, with unfamiliar hopefulness, to her senior prom. On that fateful night, the doomed girl’s persecution is taken to a new level by a malicious conspiracy, and the force of her clandestine power is finally released in a frenzy of revenge on a gymful of teens. Never has the cruelty and furious emotion that lurks beneath the surface of adolescent social life been so horrifyingly and gleefully imagined.",

        "text": "Although its ramifications are intricate, the seed of 11/22/63 is quite simple: A man named Jake Epping, living in Maine in 2011, finds a portal into the past (to September 9, 1958, at 11:58 AM, to be exact) and decides to travel back in time to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald. As Epping navigates the five years between his arrival at the end of the 1950s and the fateful day in Dallas that gives this novel its name, King applies his usual attention to detail to vividly portray the vanished world his protagonist has entered, playfully using Epping’s foreknowledge of events to enliven the narrative. Filled with vivid details and fascinating implications regarding the dependencies of time and the rippling effects of any attempt to intervene in its flow, 11/22/63 is both spine-tingling and thought-provoking, a page-turning thriller and an exhilarating attempt to fathom what fiction can grasp.",

I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers?\" That’s from the close of “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” the centerpiece of Why We Can’t Wait, and the book’s thematic fulcrum. The audience Martin Luther King Jr. is addressing is a group of eight white clergymen who had published an opinion piece in the Birmingham News describing the nonviolent campaign of protests against segregation led by King and others as the “unwise and untimely” acts of impatient extremists. The rest of Why We Can’t Wait augments its intensity with a more programmatic agenda for a civil rights revolution, an agenda that would bear fruit in landmark legislation in the mid-1960s. Although dated, even this portion of the book seems ever relevant, sadly enough, to our national discourse.",

Although The Poisonwood Bible is in some ways just as intimate as Kingsolver’s earlier books in its depiction of a family’s life, its scope and setting are anything but domestic. At the start of this story, the family in question belongs to Nathan Price, an American fundamentalist missionary who has brought his wife and four daughters into the Congo to convert the Africans to his brand of evangelical Christianity. Yet as the narrative unfolds from 1959 through the 1980s—it is told alternately in the voices of the five Price women—the family slips from Nathan’s grasp, each of its members declaring her independence from his patriarchal and increasingly fanatical rule. The author’s huge ambition is matched by her fidelity to the tenor of each major character’s soul, giving her novel an extraordinary, compelling power.",

The spinning of the tales is so entwined in Kipling’s prose that any parent reading the Just So Stories aloud is transformed into a master storyteller, and every Best Beloved will be happy to listen again and again. Which is a good thing, since it maps a path to a land of language, lore, and wonder that no reader should miss.",

He finds his journey impeded by a series of obstacles and assaults that suggest some strange plot is brewing (as, of course, it is). When Logan finally arrives at Carnglass, he finds two women being held hostage: Lady MacAskival and her adopted heir, young Mary, who possesses a preternatural—or is it supernatural?—innocence. Their captor is a satanic figure who manifests a barely concealed perpetual wound in his forehead, which he dubs his “Third Eye.” The ghost of Lady MacAskival’s husband hovers about, as well as a Pan-like figure known as the Firgower. Although actual paranormal events remain more implied than manifest, the brooding atmosphere of Carnglass and Logan’s extreme trials lure the reader into a haunted venue that transcends the normal flow of time and space, in which reality itself seems suspended precariously between states of life and death defined by no conventional understanding of birth or mortality. All in all, a neglected Gothic treat.",

Before the weekend is over, Catherine is dead, and her shy nephew is transformed into an unlikely, but ultimately successful, sleuth. Nevertheless, it’s not the sleuthing that makes this novel so memorably enjoyable; it’s the wry intelligence of the inconvenienced, slightly out-of-sorts Warren, whose offhand characterizations of the people and circumstances he encounters are just what one often looks for when seeking literary entertainment: good and diverting company. Death of My Aunt is the kind of book that, discovered unexpectedly on the shelf in a friend’s guest room during an overnight visit, will make you happily late for dinner, and eager to turn in early after the meal is done.",

What is in the few dozen battered books that have come down to us from ancient Greece to warrant their exhumation so many ages hence? These are the questions classicist Bernard Knox addresses in this splendid book. His cogent reflections touch upon many answers: that the Greeks have provided the foundation for the edifice of Western culture, and so familiarity with their works provides insight into our society’s present strengths and stresses; that we have much to learn in the pages of the ancients about eloquence, argument, inquiry, and conduct; that the longer our human perspective, the more meaningful will be its focus on civilization’s failures and successes.",

The eldest of four children and the only girl, Claudia feels taken for granted by her Greenwich, Connecticut, parents. Tired of doing all the chores, getting the smallest allowance in her class, and always doing the right thing, she decides she’ll run away just long enough to teach her mother and father a lesson in “Claudia appreciation.” Not being one for hardship, however, she concocts an elaborate plan to hide out in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan with her younger brother Jamie. But the book really takes off when Claudia determines to solve the mystery of the museum’s latest acquisition, a beautifully sculpted marble angel. Dogged pursuit of clues leads Claudia and Jamie to Farmington, Connecticut, and into the curious world of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the statue’s eccentric former owner. The whole story, which is told in the form of a letter from Mrs. Frankweiler to her lawyer, is as delightful and unforgettable as Claudia herself, who has proved to be one of the most influential characters in modern children’s literature.",

And on the morning of May 10, after fifty-seven hours without sleep, he indeed reached the summit and stood with one foot in Nepal, one in Tibet. As he began the difficult descent, an unexpected storm struck. Although Krakauer struggled safely back to his camp, more than two dozen climbers, from his own and other parties, were still on the mountain. Krakauer’s gripping account of the events of that tragic day, from the rigors of his own experience to the deadly horrors the fatal storm delivered, is one of the most riveting and harrowing adventure stories ever told, set down, as the author puts it, in “the calamity’s immediate aftermath, in the roil and torment of the moment.”",

From “A hole is to dig” to “Hands are to hold,” from “Toes are to dance on” to “Eyebrows are to go over the eyes,” from “Mashed potatoes are to give everybody enough” to “The sun is so it can be a great day,” Krauss’s words, engaging in themselves, are enhanced and animated by the marvelous drawings of an illustrator at the very beginning of his career: Maurice Sendak. By turns hilarious, endearing, and uncannily profound, Krauss’s tiny masterpiece is catnip for kids, and strangely—almost blissfully—satisfying for adults.",

        "text": "Dense and deeply erudite, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is not an easy read, yet the provocative themes it articulates repay a reader’s pondering. Kuhn argues that science is not a gradually and logically advancing discipline, but rather a “series of peaceful interludes punctuated by intellectually violent revolutions”—that scientists are generally not innovators who question everything, but conservative figures who most often work within established methodologies and patterns of thought, even going so far as to resist developments that would seem to shed doubt on current wisdom. Only when the prevailing view of nature undergoes a “paradigm shift”—because of some “new sort of fact” that existing frameworks cannot assimilate—do scientific revolutions occur; they are fomented not by added knowledge so much as by anomaly. (The cross-discipline popularity of the phrase “paradigm shift” in public discourse today is one of the legacies of Kuhn’s book.) By asserting that science is not progress toward a fixed goal but an evolutionary unfolding of understanding, Kuhn incited controversy; his book about the nature of revolutionary thinking was, in itself, revolutionary.",

The stories, sparely told, are playfully digressive, animated by the yearnings and aspirations of a swirling cast of poets, waitresses, lovers, dissidents, angels, and nudists. These inhabit a fictive space that transcends—but paradoxically is not beyond the reach of—political reality. The interruptions come in the form of dancing bits of commentary by the author, encompassing history and autobiography, philosophy and music theory, as well as flights of fancy and metaphor. Tolerant, probing, and ruefully good humored, it celebrates the secret (and not always momentous) lives of memory and meaning that totalitarian authority strips from its subjects, and which Kundera, through his exhilarating art, seeks to restore.",

        "text": "To consider the list of characters in Tony Kushner’s Angels in America is to envision a television skit of scattershot satirical energies: a gay couple whose lives combine the family inheritances of Jewish guilt and WASP prerogative; a young Mormon husband and wife, he closeted and career minded, a clerk to a federal appeals court judge, she agoraphobic and navigating her apartment-bound metropolitan life with Valium and hallucinatory visions; an Orthodox rabbi; a Reagan administration Department of Justice public relations flak; a doctor; a drag queen; the “World’s Oldest Bolshevik”; mannequins from the Diorama Room in the Mormon Visitors Center; Ethel Rosenberg; and, finally, a chorus of angels.  The AIDs epidemic in Reagan-era America provides the context for Kushner’s surreal and emotionally evocative portrayal of the currents of desire, repression, grief, and empathy that course through both the body politic and the heart romantic. By combining magical realism with melodrama, satire, and naturalism, Kushner moves his audience across dimensions of experience—sexual, historical, biological, political, interpersonal, religious—that are usually more contiguous in life than in art. The result, both in performance and on the page, is an experience as disconcerting as it is rewarding, a play both unflinching and magnanimous.",

There are her sympathetic parents, both of whom are scientists and one of whom, her father, has gone missing in the course of his research into the space-time continuum. Despite their brilliance, the adult Murrys nonetheless—thrillingly for the adolescent reader—rely on their children for aid and solace. Along the way, L’Engle depicts societies utopian, dystopian, and in between, augmenting the action with the enigmas of quantum physics and grounding its resolution in the verities of Christian virtue: humility, hope, love. Readers won’t want to put the book down, and will be happy to have four subsequent volumes in the Time Quintet to pick up when they do.",

        "text": "Witty, wealthy, vengeful, and bored, the glamorous antiheroes of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 1782 novel, Dangerous Liaisons (Les Liaisons Dangereuses), are connoisseurs of sex as pastime, game, and weapon. The sinisterly charming Vicomte de Valmont has his eye on a beautiful but married visitor, Madame de Tourvel, and determines to have her. But his co-conspirator, the Marquise de Merteuil, asks if he won’t concentrate on despoiling the teenage Cécile de Volanges instead, so as to exact some revenge for the Marquise. Entirely epistolary in form, the novel unfolds in the characters’ own words, lending a fraught intimacy to the narrative: Each voice echoes thrillingly in the cruel emptiness that Valmont and the Marquise have made the context of the collective correspondence. Through his scandalous invention, author Choderlos de Laclos made his book a commentary on the corruption and libertinism of the ancien régime less than a decade before its collapse beneath the passionate energies of the Revolution. With its vivid depiction of the depraved impulses of its aristocratic protagonists and the cunning immorality of empowered desire, it’s no wonder Dangerous Liaisons is still seducing readers more than two hundred years hence.",

        "text": "“The last years of Henry II’s reign saw a display of opulence and gallantry such as has never been equalled in France,” begins this pioneering novel, written a century after the period it describes and populated with historical figures, a notable exception being its fictive heroine. She is an heiress of marriageable age—sixteen years old—who, because of intrigues beyond her control, finds her nuptial prospects limited to a proposal from the Prince de Clèves, an unexceptionable figure whom she does not love. With characteristic candor, she declares this fact to him even as she accepts his hand. Soon after the wedding, the princess meets the gallant Duc de Nemours and finds his charms almost irresistible. Almost, because despite the strength of their mutual attraction, the princess will not betray her vows to her husband, even as she confesses to him her ardor for the other man. Forgoing external action—the traditional matter of narrative fiction at the time she wrote—for interior states of thought and feeling, Lafayette confers both resonance and relevance upon the inner life. Her book has often been called one of the earliest psychological novels, which is true enough; what the designation leaves out is the fact that the science of psychology reared its head only after Madame de Lafayette was long gone.",

        "text": "A philosophical novel invested with drama and intrigue by the insidious intimacy of its narrator, an embittered retainer at the court of a Renaissance Italian prince, The Dwarf views human nature through the window of a misanthropy as keenly observant as it is unreliable. Imagine a book-length interior monologue by a character as insinuating as Othello’s Iago, and you’ll have some idea of the alluring confidences of the dwarf, Piccoline, and of the Shakespearean intuitions into human nature that Pär Lagerkvist evokes. Along the way, Lagerkvist’s novel, written during the twentieth-century agony of World War II, expands into an enigmatically eloquent questioning of the inspiration at the heart of Renaissance humanism: Can man, The Dwarf unforgettably asks, really be the measure of all things?",

And just as Munro uses what may seem at first a small canvas of Canadian life to intuit the distant longings of the human heart, so—in Interpreter of Maladies, especially—Lahiri uses the displacements and transformations of America’s diverse population of Indian immigrants to illuminate the home truths of an increasingly unbounded world. Interpreter of Maladies is distinguished throughout by Lahiri’s sympathetic recognition of desires that are not quite up to their own fulfillment, of loves that are dislodged but nevertheless accommodated to new surroundings, of goodness that must make do with the indifferent destinies life has in store for it. Like uncanny and lasting benedictions, her haunting evocations of human frailty leave readers strangely heartened.",

Notes on a Cowardly Lion was his first book, and it remains one of the most eloquent and rewarding volumes about show business ever written. The author’s fascination with his own father is allied to an incisive theatrical intelligence. He sensitively plumbs the grief surrounding Lahr’s relations with his vaudeville partner and early love Mercedes, whose mental illness haunted the actor throughout his life (“You understand, John, I was very ambitious,” the older man tells his son, “and I just didn’t see anything but my plans”). He is equally adept at delineating the intricate choreography of comedy routines, deciphering backstage logistics, and portraying the psychological demands of both onstage artistry and offstage uncertainty. Imbued with both critical acumen and filial affection (the latter all the more moving for being candid and clear-eyed), John Lahr’s book is an absorbing and poignant testament.",

        "text": "Set in Sicily largely in the three decades after 1860, when the unification of Italy and the energy of a new, bourgeois merchant class threatened the ancient feudal order of the island, Lampedusa’s novel dramatizes the changing of the guard through the experience of Don Fabrizio, prince of the house of Salina. The wealth of his estates affords him the leisure to passively observe the tumultuous events around him even as he, an amateur astronomer, ponders the unfolding of celestial time. His tragic sense of life infuses the incidents of the novel—the invasion of Sicily by Garibaldi, assignations and liturgies, property inspections and consultations with clergy, the marriage of a favored nephew to the daughter of a vulgar parvenu, a grand ball—with regret and fateful melancholy. The aristocrats, insurgents, peasants, and relatives that people his world are drawn with skepticism and sympathy in equal measure; the grand novel they inhabit—rich, tender, engrossing, intoxicating—is not easily put down.",

Written four decades after the events it describes, it is based on extensive interviews with surviving members of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s crew and upon the original diaries they kept despite the desperate circumstances of their Antarctic ordeal. The result is the rarest sort of book—a real-life adventure that outshines the most excited praise a publisher can put on its cover: thrilling! gripping! suspenseful! intense! a classic rousing tale! True, true, true—and then some. On nearly every page it displays the singular character of a man unrivaled in his ability to motivate, inspire, and lead a company to light through the bleakest, most frightening darkness.

In its pages, he came of age as a novelist by re-creating—through the story of Paul Morel, an artistic boy with a fierce attachment to his mother—his own formative years in an English coal-mining village. Frank O’Connor once said that Sons and Lovers starts out as a nineteenth-century novel and ends up as a twentieth-century one; as a result, readers are treated in its pages to both the rich setting and narrative rootedness of the former and the exhilaratingly uneasy explorations of psychological and sexual dynamics that characterize the latter.",

It chronicles the author’s decades of correspondence with a remarkable array of gardeners in the South and beyond—from Mrs. U. B. Evans, who grew seventeen different kinds of crinum (a flowering bulb) on a plantation near Ferriday, Louisiana, to Joe Smith, of Lamoni, Iowa, who published his own monthly bulletin for almost fifty years—for whom the market bulletins provided sociable sources of income, news, expertise, and comfort. The book welcomes readers into a world of flowers and friendship as rich and restorative as a spell in the garden on a fine day. Even better, it introduces the uninitiated to the works of a writer of rare delicacy, strength, and substance.",

In thrall to “the expediency of temporary alliances” that makes them pawns in an amoral but mortal calculus, his always compromised characters move through an alienated existence wearing the masks of their assumed identities. The price of their disguises is le Carré’s recurring theme, and it is nowhere more powerfully explored than in The Spy Who Came In from the Cold, in which one man’s weariness, confusion, and pervasive doubt cross the border of his peculiar occupation to resonate with broader, if less dramatic, human truths. It is very hard to forget.",

The richness of the tale, and that of the five Earthsea sequels that followed it, relies in large part on the deep mythic backstory Le Guin layers into her fascinating maritime geography; this resonant network is augmented by an organic system of magic that eschews glibness for the arduousness of any true craft. If A Wizard of Earthsea is often characterized as a young adult novel, it may be because it engages, with probity and a sense of reverence, themes often underplayed in books for grown-ups: ethics, empathy, and understanding of the vital ecological balance in which both nature and culture are implicated and entwined. Why these thematic concerns are less prominent in books for adults is puzzling, since they provide the coordinates for the moral compass we require to actually be grown up. Which is to say that adults will profit from this novel, and from the cycle it spawned, as much as their children.",

        "text": "Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird is near the top of the list of most-beloved American novels. Set in Depression-era Alabama, it is the story of six-year-old Jean Louise Finch, better known as Scout; her older brother, Jeremy, nicknamed Jem; and their father, Atticus Finch, a middle-aged lawyer whose brave defense of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman, provides the fulcrum of the plot. Told through Scout’s eyes, the narrative renders small-town experience through the hues of wonder and worry that color childhood, and through the lenses of illusions large and small: ideals of justice, idealization of a father, confidence that the wheels of the world might well turn things right in the end, whatever obstacles are strewn in their path. The people of the town, and especially the Finches’ neighbors, among them the mysterious Boo Radley, are vivid presences; their personalities provide a largely friendly context for Scout’s upbringing, even as she comes to realize the racial prejudice and violence that shadow the community she inhabits.",

Home life with a brood of siblings, school life with an assortment of fellow students, imaginative life in its wonder, perplexity, and desperate innocence—all pass before us, not just recalled but quickened with a youthful eye and enthusiasm. Carrying the common tune of family and village life, Lee embellishes it with lyrical evocations of the fitful energies of adolescence—so fierce and tender, awkward and arrogant, “valiant and easy.” The author animates as well the last days of his village, portraying the seasoned existence that would soon vanish from his Cotswold valley as the twentieth century overtook the countryside’s well-tempered time: “I belonged to that generation which saw, by chance, the end of a thousand years’ life.” In its language and its yearnings, Cider with Rosie is among the most beautiful books you’ll ever read.",

Quite simply, Another Self is a joy to read.",

He even coined the phrase “sword and sorcery” to name the subgenre he helped create—which would eventually evolve beyond the page into Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. The title story in this 1957 volume appeared in 1939, and Leiber would add to the Fafhrd and Gray Mouser canon for the next fifty years. His distinct yet utterly devoted mercenary heroes—one tall, muscular, blunt; the other short, wiry, and canny—were loyal to each other through thick and thin, whether encountering gods or demons, gorgeous temptresses or grasping wizards. Nehwon and its prize city of Lankhmar, the setting Leiber invented as the scene of the pair’s exploits, have, like the stories themselves, both enchanted readers and influenced some of the most inspired science fiction and fantasy writers of later generations, such as Terry Pratchett and Joanna Russ.",

This is certainly true of the wacky fables and allegories found in The Cyberiad, which offers an appealing introduction to the author’s universe through its chronicle of the interstellar doings of a pair of robots, Trurl and Klapaucius. These two chums, nearly omnipotent “constructors” (they can literally shift the position of stars in the heavens, but, in a typical Lem touch, do so only for the purpose of spelling out an advertisement), are generally benevolent. Lem uses this improbable pursuit of an ideal society as an itinerary along which he displays both his erudition and his amusement at the foibles of all thinking beings.",

Ruminative and a touch melancholic, he is a good and compassionate man whom Leon makes deeply interesting. (Is there anything harder for a writer to do?) Friends in High Places is the ninth book in the series and a splendid representative of its mature pleasures. As always, Brunetti's navigation of the tide of municipal corruption leaves him on the shore of a lagoon of moral quandaries as old and inscrutable as the city itself.",

        "text": "Elmore Leonard’s Edgar Award-winning novel is the story of Joe LaBrava, an ex-Secret Service agent who gets involved with a former movie star he first became infatuated with as an adolescent, when he was wowed by her big-screen allure. Decades later, in real life, Jean Shaw is still a stunner, and she’s being harried by a couple of menacing—albeit colorful—thugs. Set in Florida’s South Beach before its recent glitzy renaissance, this 1983 thriller evokes the atmosphere of the films noirs that Shaw once starred in as well as the bygone glamour of an older, celebrity-studded Miami. But what it delivers best of all is its author’s trademark blend of hardboiled suspense, high-spirited invention, and outrageous characters; it’s both funny and frightening at the same time.",

Encompassing an extraordinary range of subjects—antiquity, language, history, metaphysics, science, the evolution of human society and institutions, aesthetics, poetry, the passions, theology, and, most tellingly, human nature as reflected in all of these—Zibaldone is like an intellectual scripture filled with learning, rumination, revelation, stories, invocations, ancient wisdom, emerging scientific discoveries, and imaginative epiphanies.",

The youngest daughter of the seventeen Franklin children (Benjamin, six years her senior, was the youngest son), Jane married at fifteen and bore twelve children, only one of whom would survive her. Her circumscribed life—as homebound and obscurely domestic as her brother’s was expansive and renowned—is illuminated by Lepore’s vivid reading of her subject’s opinionated and perceptive—if less than polished—correspondence and private writings. The author’s probing consideration of the different fortunes of brother and sister is haunting and revelatory.",

        "text": "“After all,” says Molly Jacobs to her friend Anna Wulf, the novelist who is the protagonist of Doris Lessing’s 1962 masterpiece, “you aren’t someone who writes little novels about the emotions. You write about what’s real.” At more than six hundred pages, The Golden Notebook itself is certainly not little, and the reality it portrays, as well as the manner of that portrayal, make it a landmark work. Having published one successful novel, an autobiographical work of her coming-of-age in Southern Rhodesia, Anna, now living in London, suffers from writer’s block, at least in terms of marketable fiction. There is, however, no shortage of words put on paper—specifically, entries into the several notebooks that Anna keeps. Structurally innovative, The Golden Notebook interweaves long passages from Anna’s notebooks with episodes of a conventionally narrated tale of Molly and Anna’s friendship in 1950s London, disrupting chronology and continuity in the process. Although its depictions of radical politics and the gestation of mid-twentieth-century feminism supply the “headlines” that have won The Golden Notebook a prominent place in the history of the modern novel, the full story it reports is more nuanced, intimate, human, and, in the way of all true and lasting fiction, more useful for our understanding of the worries and wonders of our own lives.",

Lessing’s complex and at times obscure visionary architecture looms over but never overwhelms her storytelling gifts, and from page to page we follow a powerful and resilient thread of human feeling through a labyrinth of foreboding and catastrophe.",

Her husband, Dick, is wandering mad in the bush, and her Bantu servant, having confessed to the murder, has been arrested. What follows is the story of how Mary went from being a contented urban career woman, unencumbered in every way, to a deranged farm wife, suffering the constrained economic and psychological circumstances of life as a “poor white” on the veld, taking out her unhappiness on her failure of a husband and a string of native houseboys. It is the story of how the expectations of her time and place—the 1940s in Rhodesia—led her to forsake her freedom for marriage at thirty and, ultimately, for a loneliness and isolation that distill into misery the potent malevolence of rural colonialism, in which the suspicions and resentments of “us against them” overtake sympathy for both self and others. The Grass Is Singing is a brilliant portrait of a time and place that, while steeped in remote particulars, reflects essential human fears and failings that are never all that far from home, no matter where we live.",

        "text": "Although steeped in the world of Anthony Trollope, Shirley Robin Letwin’s curious and uncategorizable book is not a study of the work of that novelist per se. Rather, the vast canvas of Trollope’s novels provides Letwin with the raw material for what is in actuality a philosophical study, one that blessedly exhibits in abundance a quality absent from most such works: a resonance that rings true with our experience of the world. There is no need to be conversant with Trollope’s fiction to follow Letwin’s thought (although, having followed it, you’re unlikely not to want to sample at least a volume or two). And there is no need to be put off by her subject on grounds of gender: “The most perfect gentleman in Trollope’s novels,” writes Letwin, “is Madame Max Goesler.” Her surprising book earns a spot on a shelf just below Montaigne; one might spend a lifetime absorbing its lessons in hopes of inhabiting the “gentleman’s world” that she describes, a world full of nuances “that does not require a choice between rebellion and submission, violence and reason, alienation and unity, struggle and apathy, certainty and nihilism.”",

He wasn’t planning to write a book, he later explained; all he wanted to do was unburden himself, writing down his thoughts as an act of therapy. Yet soon the random recollections started to cohere into a larger testimony, one of the first autobiographical texts from a survivor of the Holocaust and one of the most powerful works of nonfiction published in the twentieth century: If This Is a Man. Our moral obligation to remember the Holocaust, a responsibility that grows stronger as the number of survivors declines, has made Levi’s book a document of world-historical importance.",

But just so does anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss embark upon this narrative of his progress across the ocean, then up the Amazon to observe the lives of indigenous tribes: the Caduveo, Bororo, Nambikwara, and Tupi-Kawahib. The reader expecting a picturesque travelogue will find the author true to his first words, for the exotic itinerary that leads Lévi-Strauss to such remote destinations—and to an illuminating portrayal of “human society reduced to its most basic expression”—is not the primary journey Tristes Tropiques describes. That distinction belongs to the voyage that begins and ends in the mind of the protagonist: a bold and exacting intellectual adventure that transports us, page by page, to unexpected outposts of thought, imagery, and intellection.",

Initial uneasiness at their ministrations turns into a growing suspicion of their motives, and Rosemary begins to imagine all sorts of dark doings. Or is she imagining them? The suspense ratchets up as what she expects while she’s expecting takes a diabolical turn—proving, of course, that just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t out to get you.

On the first day of exploring their new abode, little Lucy discovers a mirror-fronted wardrobe in an otherwise bare room; creeping into it, she crosses an unmarked threshold to find herself in an unexpected place indeed—a snow-covered wood. Curiosity lures her forward toward a lamppost and a strange figure, half man, half goat, holding an umbrella. As she soon discovers, she has wandered into Narnia, a fantastical realm corrupted by the influence of an evil White Witch who has usurped the power of a mighty lion king, Aslan, and cast the land into permanent winter, “without any Christmas.” Lewis held the view that “a children’s story which is enjoyed only by children is a bad children’s story.” Wanting his book to offer something to older readers as well, he shaped the Pevensie children’s Narnian escapade into a religious allegory of betrayal, forgiveness, and resurrection. The seed that grew into The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe also sprouted six additional Narnia tales. All of these are worth reading, but none is as thrilling, magical, and memorable as the first. It is an ideal tale for a family to read aloud together.",

Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led the twenty-eight-month, eight-thousand-mile journey from Saint Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River on the Oregon coast and back again. At Jefferson’s behest, they kept extensive journals of their mission across country upon which, Lewis writes, “the foot of civilized man had never trodden.” Meticulously recording their routes and progress; the weather they witness; their discipline and invention in assembling, fabricating, and husbanding provisions; their hunger, cold, and other discomforts; and their often friendly, sometimes anxious encounters and negotiations with Native American tribes, the explorers document their adventures in extraordinary empirical—if less than grammatically and orthographically elegant—detail. The grandeur and surprises of the magnificent landscape they traverse are palpable to the reader. Although one might take issue with Lewis’s assertion of the primacy of his party’s “civilized” presence on the already-peopled land, there can be no doubt of the freshness of the wonder they experienced.",

It offers an irreverent inside look at the world of investment banking as it flourished before the crash that came before the crash that came before the most recent crash. Which is to say that, although the details of life on the Street may have undergone some transformations in the intervening years, the general tenor of Lewis’s tale of outsized egos and preposterous sums of money retains its ring of truth.",

One of those classic works is Voices of the Old Sea, which vividly recounts the three summers Lewis spent, immediately after the end of World War II, in the remote Spanish fishing village of Farol on what is now the Costa Brava. At the time Lewis first arrived in the community, Farol still bore traces of the medieval heritage that shaped it; life revolved around seasonal sardine catches and ancient feuds—feuds between individuals, feuds between families, feuds with the neighboring village. Lewis witnessed the old order’s passing, as postwar tourism began to change Farol utterly. In the limpid, elegant prose that was his trademark, Lewis chronicled the various changes—some of them terribly sad, others absurdly funny—in this eloquent elegy to the old sea’s influence.",

A scathing anatomy of small-town narrow-mindedness in the early years of the twentieth century, Main Street tells the story of Carol Milford, an idealistic young woman who works at a library in Saint Paul. After marrying Dr. Will Kennicott, Carol agrees to settle down in Gopher Prairie, Will’s hometown (which Lewis modeled after his own Minnesota hometown of Sauk Centre). Although Carol hopes to lead Gopher Prairie out of what she considers its dull and complacent ordinariness, her eager attempts at transforming the town into a place of beauty and culture are thwarted by the entrenched snobbery, hypocrisy, and provincialism that define it. More than eighty years on, Lewis’s satire remains brisk and keenly observed, his targets not as far from our experience as we might hope.",

Moving back and forth in time, Liebling follows his love affair with Paris from naive ardor to nostalgic afterglow, ultimately shadowing his youthful enthusiasms with the awareness of age and loss that return trips reveal. How satisfying it is to share the hunger, intoxication, and joie de vivre of his recollection.",

In thirty brief chapters, Lightman—an astrophysicist who became the first professor at MIT to receive a joint appointment in the sciences and the humanities—presents a series of speculative worlds purportedly dreamed by the young patent clerk Albert Einstein over two and a half months in 1905, the year in which work on his theory of special relativity came to fruition. The little tales, incidents, and situations Lightman invents to quicken Einstein’s slumbers are both intellectually provocative and spiritually stimulating evocations of the most pervasive and mysterious element of existence.",

Douglas during their Illinois senate race—reveals his keen political mind, his capacity for embracing and/or deflecting opposition, and his talent for pragmatic leadership, to say nothing of his wit and insight into human behavior. No other president has had such a spare, strong, inspired way with words: His felicity of expression is both personal and timeless.",

Others of singular inspiration, such as James Joyce, compose entire cities with their words, or, like Kafka, create strange dominions entirely their own; still others of capacious imagination—think Proust or Virginia Woolf—conjure from psychology and social relations a superreality as shifting and encompassing as the weather, thereby describing with revelatory attention the climate of our lives. While the work of Clarice Lispector puts her in the same league as such extraordinary literary magicians, what’s most remarkable about it is the way it moves, with grace and no little glamour, from humdrum domestic scenes to ominous visionary realms to streams of feeling as stealthy, dangerous, and exhilarating as the wind. It is that more delicate and difficult reality that Lispector captures in these stories, a reality not hung on a plotline or conforming to a conventional narrative, but following the inspirations and intuitions, the rhythms and hesitancies, the anxieties and epiphanies of unfolding experience. They are as truthful and electrifying as any an inner life has ever spun.",

Also on hand is the boy Tommy Stubbins, the local cobbler’s son who is pulled into Dolittle’s curious orbit. Throughout, Lofting’s wit and warmth, and the beautifully realized characters (both human and animal), provide a happy counterpoint to the compelling melody of their perilous escapades, making The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle a perfect vehicle in which to explore the pleasure and promise of storytelling.",

A favorite of his owner, Buck has known a placid, even pampered life in California’s Santa Clara Valley—until the day this “sated aristocrat” is dog-napped and finds himself “jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial.” Sold first to a man supplying sled dogs to those caught up in the Klondike gold rush of the late 1890s, and then to a pair of Canadian government couriers, Buck soon learns that, in order to survive in the harsh Northland, he must submit to “the law of club and fang.” Instincts long dormant begin to reawaken in him, and London thrillingly depicts the process of Buck’s “decivilization” as he acclimates himself to his alluring, impulsive new life. Even as he develops bonds of loyalty and love with one master, John Thornton, Buck is remade by the wild into a fierce and merciless creature, eventually abandoning the world of men altogether. That, in brief, is the story of The Call of the Wild, a book that—despite the way its subject and style contrasted with the gentility of contemporary popular fiction—was an immediate sensation, earning Jack London’s place in the public eye as the most celebrated author of his day.

No book captures this quality with more concentration than Arctic Dreams. “It is precisely because the regimes of light and time in the Arctic are so different,” Lopez writes, “that the landscape is able to expose in startling ways the complacency of our thought about land in general.” And not just about land, but about creation in all its vast scale and intimate detail. The product of nearly five years’ travel as a field biologist in the Arctic, from the Bering Strait in the west to the Davis Strait in the east, Lopez’s narrative invites us to observe—and celebrate—the glorious particularities of nature and culture that distinguish what at first appear to be nothing more than “great, unrelieved stretches of snow and ice.” Reviewing this book for the New York Times, the esteemed nature writer Edward Abbey rightly called it “jubilant,” and aptly described Lopez as a man “who can’t wait to get up in the morning. What is prodigious about him is not so much his travels, which are impressive, but how happy he is in the course of them.”",

But few if any of them have been more influential or more inspired by such undisguised love for “man’s best friend.” Thanks to long and affectionate observation of the dogs in his own life, Lorenz’s writing brims with striking details and pleasing anecdotes as he addresses both practical and theoretical questions familiar to any dog owner. Man Meets Dog is not primarily a training manual, and yet, through its brilliant hypotheses and its thoughtful, humane advice, any curious human can arrive at a deeper understanding of the canine worldview and how it defines relations both among dogs and between dogs and humans. In these civilizing pages, a wise and kindly mentor teaches readers a lot about dogs—and about themselves, too.",

It’s set in the year 1918, when an impetuous and self-serving fellow named Charles Dexter Ward gets curious about his colonial-era ancestor Joseph Curwen. Curwen’s reputation for eternal youth, grave robbing, and experiments with monsters provokes his descendant to unwisely proceed with a resurrection of his wizardly forebear.

It is 1938, and the forty-one-year-old Firmin, known as “the Consul,” is drowning in drink. The day, as it happens, is the Day of the Dead, and the Mexican town in which the book is set is vivid with ominous festivities. Firmin’s ex-wife, Yvonne, has just rejoined him after a year’s absence. Also on hand is his younger half-brother, Hugh, who also happens to be Yvonne’s former lover. Both Yvonne and Hugh want to rescue Geoffrey from his descent into dissolution, and they follow him hour by hour from bar to bar as the Consul turns through the circles of his own inferno, his existence reduced to nothing more than “his rejection of life.” As Malcolm Lowry wrote in a letter to a potential publisher, it “can be regarded as a kind of symphony”; indeed, the literary music it makes is seductive and spellbinding, reverberating with the impassioned futility of one man’s terror, guilt, and remorse.",

In 7,500 hexameter lines that convey a wealth of natural imagery, scientific inquiry, and meditation both metaphorical and metaphysical, Lucretius charts the workings of the universe on an ambitious intellectual journey informed by the teachings of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, who lived some three centuries before the Roman poet. A surprising precursor to the later ruminations of Wordsworth, Yeats, and the T. S. Eliot of Four Quartets, The Way Things Are is one of the most neglected treasures of classical culture.",

To set an amnesiac loose in such a nexus of determinedly shifting identities adds an extra shot to the conventional spy novel cocktail. This is what Robert Ludlum famously did in The Bourne Identity, the seed from which would grow not only two more volumes in his own trilogy—The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum—but also a posthumous extension of the brand in a shelf of novels by Eric Van Lustbader, to say nothing of the Bourne film franchise. Relying more on suspense than detonations, Ludlum’s original is highly charged storytelling nonetheless, the story of a man on the run who must decide the direction and purpose of his flight without the benefit of knowing his past.",

A year later, invited to accompany an importer on a buying trip to France, he discovered his true calling. In the decades between then and now, Lynch has sniffed, swirled, and tasted his way to prominence as one of America’s most renowned importers of wines of character made the old-fashioned way—especially those that won’t break the bank. Part memoir and part travelogue, Adventures on the Wine Route is also a manifesto about the wine business and the ways in which conglomeration, trends, and market demands can threaten the very things that make the fruit of the vine worth savoring. Peppered with gorgeous (and often amusing) black-and-white photos by Gail Skoff, the book is suffused with the qualities the author seeks in casks and bottles—nuance, surprise, subtlety, expression, authenticity. By turns wise\nand very funny, Lynch—to say nothing of the many quirky vignerons he introduces us to—is good company indeed on this delightfully readable tour of the wine regions of France.",

Poignant, lamenting, and good-humoredly morbid, Lynch’s meditations on our mortality explore such themes as the bonds between the living and dead, the ties of family and community, and, especially, the customs and ceremonies by means of which we humans create meaning: “Just as we declare the living alive through baptisms, lovers in love by nuptials,” Lynch observes, “funerals are the way we close the gap between the death that happens and the death that matters. It’s how we assign meaning to our little remarkable histories.” Greeted with praise and prizes by the literary world, it has also had a notable effect on popular culture: Alan Ball, the creator of the hit HBO series Six Feet Under, has credited The Undertaking as the primary inspiration for that offbeat show, which focused on a family-run funeral home in Los Angeles.",

The talk—which unfolds in the weekly epistles the gentlemen exchanged from 1955 until Lyttelton’s death in 1962—bustles with Hart-Davis’s incessant activity (including editing the letters of Oscar Wilde, publishing a celebrated array of authors, and occupying the center of London’s literary culture) and brims with his elder’s wide reading, rich store of experience, and pure delight in having an audience for the comings and goings of his fertile mind.

Born in Moorish Granada in 1488, Hasan fled Spain with his family to Fez to escape the Inquisition, journeyed extensively through Africa and the Middle East, was captured by Sicilian oceangoing brigands and taken to Rome and presented to Pope Leo X, who baptized him as Johannes Leo. While in Italy he wrote a trilingual medical dictionary (in Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew) as well as his famous Description of Africa, for which he is remembered as Leo Africanus. Organized into forty chapters corresponding to the first forty years of Hasan’s life, the book is part history, part travelogue, and, delightfully, part picaresque, replete with pirates and princesses; it places its hero within view of many of the prominent events and personalities of his politically and culturally dynamic time.",

        "text": "In the late 1920s, after having enjoyed a girlhood of piano lessons, ballet, and the like, young Betty MacDonald moved with her new husband onto a chicken farm. The dilapidated forty-acre property was buried deep in the wilds of Washington State’s Olympic Peninsula, where the towering peaks of the Olympic Mountains were, to Betty at least, like disagreeable guests who would never, ever leave. Although her first book about life on the farm, The Egg and I, made MacDonald’s name as a writer, the liveliest and most satisfying of her four excellent memoirs is Anybody Can Do Anything, a high-spirited celebration of family love and laughter. The story opens in 1931, when MacDonald, whose maiden name was Bard, returns with her two daughters to the happily chaotic, close-knit Bard household after four years on the aforementioned chicken farm (marriage being less tractable, it seems, than memoir). The Depression is darkening the country at the time, but it doesn’t depress the Bards any, least of all Betty’s sister Mary, who looks upon the national crisis as a personal challenge, a time to put to the test her belief that “anybody can do anything, especially Betty.” MacDonald has a lot of fun at the expense of the offices she finds herself in and the bosses and coworkers she encounters (for example, “One of the first things I learned and loved about the Government was that I wasn’t the only bonehead working for it”). But it’s the affectionate portrait of her zany family that brings out the down-to-earth best in MacDonald the writer, and that remains delightful even today.",

Hugh Chantry-Pigg, on a trek from Istanbul to the fabled Trebizond. Exploiting the appeal of the ancient terrain to modern pilgrims of various stripes (“I wonder who else is rambling about Turkey this spring,” says Aunt Dot. “Seventh-Day Adventists, Billy Grahamites, writers, diggers, photographers, spies, us, and now the B.B.C.”), the first part of The Towers of Trebizond is leavened with comic questions. Will Father Chantry-Pigg be able to establish a High Anglican mission in Turkey? Will Dot emancipate Turkish women by coaxing them to wear hats? As the book progresses and Laurie is left to her own devices, her grapplings with loves both sacred and profane push the book’s high spirits onto a loftier plane of inquiry. There the tantalizing uncertainties of belief are revealed to be as eerily evocative as the most legend-laden ruin.",

The episodes, etched in irony, add up to a paean to pessimism that is as startling as it is amiable.

The traditional view of governance held that a ruler earned the respect and obedience of his subjects by ruling virtuously. But the principle at the heart of The Prince is that virtue as such has no place in politics. Moral strictures and ethical commandments, Machiavelli argued, must never tie a prince’s hands; his only concern is to get and keep power. In other words, when it comes to governing, the end justifies the means. It is a notion for which Machiavelli was condemned for centuries (some contemporaries called him an agent of the devil), but seldom by those in a position to understand his perception’s utility. Today we call Machiavelli’s devilish pragmatism “realpolitik.” By combining his firsthand experience of cutthroat political turbulence with extensive research into historical precedents and a keen sense of how self-interest shapes human behavior, Machiavelli composed a Renaissance textbook on power that has never gone out of date, and that remains both readable and stylish in its urbane attention to political imperatives.",

Fortune, however, eventually smiles on the islanders when the SS Cabinet Minister, bound for New York, runs aground a few hundred yards from Little Todday with a cargo of liquid gold: thousands and thousands of bottles of first-class whisky. Before you can say slàinte mhath, slàinte mhor (“good health, great health”), a parched band of industrious Toddaymen, working in their boats under cover of darkness,  relieve the stranded Minister’s packed hold, and life on the Toddays is soon back to normal, or maybe it’s even better than ever. Based on true events surrounding the 1941 shipwreck of the SS Politician off the island of Eriskay, Compton Mackenzie’s spirited novel is a tidily constructed comic yarn that unwinds with the irresistible narrative momentum of a tall tale.",

Anyone interested in twentieth-century history or susceptible to the romance of undercover intrigue will be enthralled by Fitzroy Maclean’s ripping memoir. First published in 1949, it relates the exploits that occupied the young Eton- and Cambridge-educated author during the years immediately before and after the outbreak of World War II. With the shrewd and rakish fearlessness of a true man of action, Maclean intrepidly snooped around Stalin’s off-limits Russia in the late 1930s. Then he helped found Britain’s legendary SAS (Special Air Service) and spearheaded daring raids behind Rommel’s Afrika Korps lines in the Western Desert. Best of all for the reader, these astonishing, courageous, history-making exploits are narrated in prose that’s so fluid, muscular, and rattlingly paced that Maclean could probably have made walking the dog sound gripping, had he ever stooped to anything quite so mundane.",

He roots the fundamentals of philosophy in the wonder provoked by everyday experience, pondering the nature of reality and the limitations of knowing. More broadly, his colorfully composed account of his own education and career provides readers a lucid and inviting medium through which to contemplate philosophical ideas and their historical development. From Plato to Schopenhauer to Karl Popper, from the pre-Socratics to the logical positivists to the existentialists, Magee plots the progress of humanity’s search for meaning while narrating his own, doing both with expressive eloquence and invigorating intellectual rigor.",

The book’s baroque style and picaresque mode is both a send-up of the earnest New Journalism of its era and its most idiosyncratic and memorable product.",

Its declarative simplicity pulls the reader urgently through a landscape of violence, emptiness, and everyday family bewilderment that is as profound and dramatic a depiction of American life as Mailer would draw; in its secret modulations of cadence and image, the writing is as artful as any he ever composed. Violence, crime, misdirected courage, perilous love, dreams of reincarnation, institutional insularity, the senseless and insatiable hunger of mass media—the themes that haunt the one thousand pages of The Executioner’s Song are a catalog of the author’s enduring preoccupations.",

The narrator has seen so much, he seems possessed by his visions: His imagination is able to engage all the horrors of the age and vivify them in episode upon episode of extraordinary power, each contributing to the ineluctable verdict that is this novel’s title and recurrent theme. There is not one scene or setting that is reminiscent of any other novel of World War II, and there are several—the desperate horses frozen in the ice of Lake Ladoga is one—that will haunt you for years. Kaputt is one of the great neglected books of our time.",

The name evokes the image of august chambers paneled in solemnity. But in Janet Malcolm’s penetrating profile of one turbulent period in the history of the Archives (the late 1970s and early 1980s), another picture emerges, one colored with the fireworks set off by the clash of petty egos and unbridled ids. It is a compelling, intelligent, and even amusing tale of personalities and ideas wrangling in the shadow of Freud’s influence. Malcolm’s nonfiction tale delivers all the pleasures—eccentric personalities, gripping questions of motive and evidence, conflict in a clubby setting—of a topflight mystery.",

And he’s a wonderful, amusing stylist in his own right, as his comments on the youthful entries of the novelist Evelyn Waugh—“[he] is so often drunk in the twenties that one doesn’t so much read his diaries as marinate in them”—and the psychoanalyst Karen Horney—“One can hear the girl turning into the doctor right at the comma”—make clear.",

Art, André Malraux argues, has a life of its own, and in The Voices of Silence he attempts to catch its profound and protean essence. Beginning with a discussion of the way the museum has changed our understanding of art, he sets out on an expedition to investigate the evolution of the creative act and apprehend what it reveals about human nature (and about human intuitions of the divine as well). Rich and wise, a bottomless well of absorption, The Voices of Silence is a volume for the permanent library, one to be revisited at will and opened at random again and again. It’s a lifelong talisman for any curious reader.",

Three decades later, he found himself troubled by nightmares arising from repressed memories of those experiences. “It was ironic. For years I had been trying to write about the war, always in vain. It lay too deep; I couldn’t reach it.” Now his recollections were surfacing unbidden. So in 1978 the renowned historian and biographer revisited the Pacific. The result of Manchester’s pilgrimage is a visceral, devastating, emotional, and deeply moving book, a multifaceted portrait of the war in the Pacific theater that is distinguished by its fidelity to the fate of soldiers.",

When the scathing verses came to the attention of the authorities, Mandelstam was arrested and sent into exile; arrested again in 1938, he died in a labor camp later that year. Nadezhda Mandelstam shared the life of the poet from 1919 until his disappearance into the gulag; their marriage, while unconventional, weathered the most turbulent years in Russian history. In 1964, Nadezhda began writing this powerful chronicle of the years between Osip’s first arrest and his death. The resulting memoir is one of the most formidable books of the twentieth century, a towering achievement that was hailed in the New York Times Book Review as “the most luminous account we have—or are likely to get—of life in the Soviet Union during the purges of the 1930s.”",

        "text": "The Magic Mountain, Thomas Mann’s sly, satirical novel of illness and civilization in the years before World War I, is supremely readable; more than any other modern novel of its caliber, it’s a book you can take to bed with you, for its slow unwinding of individual destinies within a communal setting evokes something akin to the feelings you might have watching the most high-minded miniseries ever filmed. Which is not to say it isn’t profound, and funny, too, filled with human foibles of every kind and replete with sexual as well as intellectual passions. All told, its unprecedented fusion of realism and symbolism appeals to the heart as much as the brain. Set almost entirely at a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, where well-to-do patients from across Europe are recovering from tuberculosis, The Magic Mountain tells the story of Hans Castorp, a young man from Hamburg, who arrives to pay a short visit to his ailing cousin Joachim. Seven years later, he’s still there breathing the mountain air, unable to return to the world below. The disease of Castorp and his fellow patients is Europe’s illness, Mann implies, and, for all its liveliness of character and incident, the novel is an elegy for a culture that the author inferred was approaching its demise.",

        "text": "In A Place of Greater Safety, we meet three ambitious young men whose lives will be forged in the crucible of revolution—provincials who’ve arrived in Paris just in time for the storming of the Bastille. They are the fiery journalist Camille Desmoulins, the pragmatic and hideously ugly orator Georges Danton, and the “incorruptible” lawyer Maximilien de Robespierre. These three friends luxuriate in the upheaval of 1789, and as the old order collapses, they establish themselves at the heart of the emergent government. But soon revolutionary fervor gives way to the violence of the Reign of Terror, and Robespierre’s uncompromising virtue places him at odds with the more moderate and more libertine Danton. Mantel does much more here than narrate the story of the French Revolution. She brings it to life, fleshing out the dreams and the desires of men and women who changed the world, intertwining personal upheavals with political ones to render history as a living thing. On Mantel’s pages, the past becomes as vibrant—and as anxious—as the present.",

        "text": "Greil Marcus describes Mystery Train as “an attempt to broaden the context in which the music is heard; to deal with rock ’n’ roll not as youth culture, or counterculture, but simply as American culture.” He does this by analyzing the work of six artists. Two of them he calls “Ancestors”: Harmonica Frank Floyd (1908–1984), an obscure “vocal contortionist” who developed “a music of staggering weirdness”; and Robert Johnson (1911–1938), the legendary Mississippi blues singer and guitarist. The other four Marcus labels “Inheritors.” Through close listening and a bold grasp of popular music’s broader, deeper contexts, Marcus illuminates the character of “Ancestors” and “Inheritors” alike, revealing how their common intuitions and individual inspirations “dramatize a sense of what it is to be an American; what it means, what it’s worth, what the stakes of life in America might be.”",

That happiness, so certain and unthreatened at first blush, will be short-lived; The Infatuations begins with an invocation of the last time María saw the husband, which was also, she relates, “the last time his wife, Luisa, saw him,” before he was fatally stabbed in the street in an act of random violence. Apparently random, that is. As María slowly becomes entangled—both speculatively and amorously—in the posthumous world of the victim’s widow and associates, disturbing clues connect the brutal homicide to an unexpected web of deceit and passion. In sinuous, exploratory sentences, María slowly unravels not only the evidence she uncovers about the couple that has infatuated her, but also the tenuous threads of coincidence, love, chance, time, and obsession that have connected her life to theirs.",

The book, too, was greeted with acclaim, notably from Ernest Hemingway, who wrote, in a letter to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, “she has written so . . . marvelously well, that I was completely ashamed of myself as a writer.” ",

A cockroach who had a former existence as a vers libre bard, archy composed his comic commentaries on the world at large late at night, by hurling himself headfirst onto each key of the sleeping Marquis’s typewriter (the logistics of holding down the shift key are too much for an insect to manage, which accounts for his trademark lowercase). His poetic compositions recount his adventures, often with his companion mehitabel, a cat in her ninth life who claims to be a reincarnation of Cleopatra and who occasionally commandeers the keys. His reflections on current events (such as Prohibition), human history, fellow denizens of the natural world, beer, literary labors, and enduring existential questions mix the world-weariness of a newsman, the wisecracking embitterment of a barfly, and the melancholic self-absorption of a Hamlet into a voice that is antic, addictive, and unforgettable.",

        "text": "Imagine when Homo sapiens started thinking. What might those first thoughts have been like? A clue to the answer came to Alexander Marshack thanks to “a bit of bone.” It was the early 1960s. At work on a book about the dawning of the space age, and trying to explain to his readers the origins of science and civilization, Marshack became intrigued by the markings on the quartz-tipped handle of an African bone tool that was several thousand years old. Other scholars interpreted such markings as decoration or prehistoric doodling; Marshack thought otherwise. As revealed in this remarkable (and profusely illustrated) volume, Marshack’s story of discovery—he was, after all, an amateur in these realms of study at the start—is as exciting as his findings would prove to be provocative. His theory of time-factoring reshaped our image of prehistory and of essential human traits in radical ways. But this book’s intellectual thrills aren’t reserved for specialists. Any reader who has ever been fascinated by the evolution of consciousness, for example, or the cave paintings at Lascaux, will find in Marshack’s pages endless material for rumination about our earliest ancestors and their profoundly thought-provoking first thoughts.",

As we learn in the first of the novel’s three parts, he passes his early youth in Pondicherry, where his father runs a zoo. The young Pi exhibits a penchant for spiritual exploration, and undergoes a religious expansion—rather than a conversion—by adding elements of Christianity and Islam to his native Hindu beliefs. The second part of the novel details what happens when his family decides to immigrate to Canada. Traveling on a vessel that carries many of the zoo’s animals, they meet with calamity in the form of shipwreck, and Pi finds himself in a lifeboat shared with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and, most importantly, a 450-pound tiger named Richard Parker. Whimsical and amusing, Life of Pi encompasses a great deal of human experience—from theology to zoology, desperation to wonder—in its drifting current of story. It’s marvelous, in the exact sense of the word.",

What’s most compelling is that the reader’s understanding of unfolding events is continually transformed by shifting narrative perspectives. Many characters are given not only history, but agency as well, in a way fiction seldom realizes: The reader’s judgment is suspended, then upended, again and again, as heroes shape-shift into villains or get caught in some uncertain liminal state. Martin’s hold on the popular mind derives from his ability to fill the bold outlines of epic fantasy with the gritty colors of historical fiction and from his narrative ruthlessness, which acknowledges that violence and sex are surer motivations than nobility and that circumstantial ambiguity determines more than a fixed moral compass.",

Whatever one’s estimation of the insurgencies that have waved his name as a banner, Marx also remains worth reading for his philosophical and historical insight, and never more so than in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, a social and political consideration of events in France between 1848 and 1851 that culminated in a coup d’état in December of the latter year. The title alludes to the date on the revolutionary calendar (Eighteen Brumaire, or November 9, 1799) on which the first Napoleon (uncle of Louis Bonaparte) seized supreme power in France, and sets up Marx’s memorable opening: “Hegel remarks somewhere that all great, world-historical facts and personages occur, as it were, twice. He has forgotten to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.” Regardless of what one makes of Marx’s ultimate interpretation of his subject, his act of engaging it is exhilarating, leading one to think about the role that history plays in contemporary events, and therefore what influence a complete detachment from historical context—as our relentlessly scrolling internet version of reality seems to demand—might have.",

The illness had particular significance for the author, as he reveals in his introduction, because it was shared by his own son. Yet it is not just Massie’s personal connection to his subject, or his sensitive attention to the Romanovs’ intimate concerns, or even his rich portrayal of Rasputin’s sinister influence that makes Nicholas and Alexandra such a memorable and enduring volume. The material the author marshals is rich enough in politics, personalities, and intrigue to provide the plots of any number of Russian novels, a shelf of studies of royal dynasties and military alliances, and at least one storybook romance (that between the title characters). As it unfolds, the familial dilemma becomes the kernel of an astonishing chronicle of history, religion, and revolution, one that encompasses both the twilight of Imperial Russia and the martyrdom of Nicholas, Alexandra, and their five children.",

        "text": "Maupin’s Tales encompass a rich array of people—gay and straight, male and female, financially struggling and well-off—who reside at (or pass in and out of) 28 Barbary Lane. The immediacy of the serial telling allows the author to indulge his gift for social satire at the same time as he is accumulating an alert social history; his artistic hand is light, yet the entertainment it weaves exhibits a recognition of the weighty search for affection and security that grounds the unbearable lightness of our lives. His characters fall in and out of love, deceive each other and reveal themselves, and, most characteristically, accept and forgive one another. The first volume introduces us to twenty-somethings of various backgrounds and proclivities, and is satisfying all by itself. As the years and tales wear on, as AIDS strikes the gay community, and as Maupin himself ages, the tenor naturally shifts to a somewhat darker register. But even those who love the later books a little less than the first—and even highbrow readers who assure themselves that all are no more than “guilty pleasures”—can’t help but read straight through all six.",

He learned on me. He did not learn easily.” The author thus introduces his memoir of the lunacy of childhood in the orbit of a brilliant paternal moon, Hiram Stevens Maxim, one of the most renowned engineers and inventors of his day. Completely unselfconscious in his paternal responsibilities, the elder Maxim treated the younger as an equal in his remarkable adventures, no matter how outrageous the situation his ingenuity might concoct. Writing from the perspective of his own middle-aged fatherhood, the author looks back with an affectionate, clear-eyed bewilderment at the child rearing he underwent, providing readers with a singular and entirely delightful reminiscence.",

But that quick description, charming as it may be, doesn’t quite do it justice. Suffused with a quirky intelligence and a fascinatingly variegated psychological texture rare in nature writing, Ring of Bright Water is a moving record of one man’s fierce attachments—to sea and soil, solitude and independence, and, last but not least, two marvelous otters named Mijbil and Edal.",

But we’re soon aware that the simplicity belongs to no pastoral idyll—the sky is endlessly gray, the rivers are the color of oil, and ash drips from above. Nearly all plants and wildlife have gone extinct. The nights, Cormac McCarthy writes, are “blinding cold and casket black.” Millions—billions—of people have died, and those unlucky enough to have survived exist on the sharp edge of starvation, either prey or predator in the cannibalistic food chain that catastrophe has unleashed. Apocalypse has come to America. It is a moving, riveting tale, an indelible vision of a future Wild West whose arrival—given the spate of climate-soaked catastrophes that dominate our news—seems more possible every day.",

The book reaches its high point when Mrs. Mallard decides to lead her progeny ashore and into the city to meet Mr. Mallard in the Public Garden. Their passage through the busy streets is aided by a helpful consort of policemen, led by the friendly Michael, who stop traffic along their route to allow them passage to a happy ending.",

Angela’s Ashes is the painful reminiscence of the family’s desperate economic slide back to the slums of Limerick; it’s about incapacitating poverty and the countless humiliations and deprivations the McCourts suffer as they daily endure life on the brink of starvation. It is filled with the close comforts and closer conflicts of an extended family, with pints and priests and all the other accoutrements of Irish chronicles. It is, in short, a catalog of loss, distress, and faith both blind and blinding. Miraculously, McCourt makes laughter ring through every step of his remembered purgatory, lifting the world’s weight and weariness with nothing more than the lilt of his voice.",

Set in the 1930s, in a southern town much like the one in which McCullers was raised, it revolves around the enigmatic figure of John Singer, a thirty-two-year-old deaf-mute who finds himself on his own after ten years of sharing a silent routine with his only friend and fellow mute, Spiros Antonapoulos. When Antonapoulos, after a stretch of increasingly erratic behavior, is committed to an asylum, Singer finds himself more isolated than ever, until he comes to board in the house of the Kelly family and becomes the confidant of four of the town’s loneliest souls: the café owner Biff Brannon, the heavy-drinking political radical Jake Blount, the black doctor Benedict Copeland, and the curious twelve-year-old girl with unattainable dreams of a musical future, Mick Kelly. These four uneasy characters, estranged from family, friends, and community by the remoteness of their longings, find consolation in the hushed politeness of Singer’s company.",

Larry McMurtry’s 1985 epic, Lonesome Dove, may be its richest literary harvest. Set in the late 1870s, it tells the story of a cattle drive from the Rio Grande to Montana, led by two former Texas Rangers, Augustus (Gus) McCrae and Woodrow F. Call, who have been friends for three decades. Along the way, McMurtry enlists all the familiar elements of Western lore: a hero capable and wise, yet easygoing (Gus), and another stoic, reticent, and duty-driven (Call); a whore with a heart, if not of gold, then glittering with allure; rogues disguised as friends; hostile Indians and bands of renegades; sheriffs in relentless pursuit and women both passionate and profoundly pragmatic; and a young cowboy who will inherit the dusty dreams of his elders. For all its cowboy grit and glory, Lonesome Dove is more than just a celebration of the Western ethos.",

Exploring how human behaviors and developments—agricultural innovation, fluctuations in population density, migration, invasion, and predation—have played a role in the complex pattern of disease since the dawn of man, as well as the counter-influences of stabilization and immunization, McNeill mapped new territory, much of it necessarily speculative but nonetheless fascinating and enlightening. From the ancient epidemic that left Athens outmanned by Sparta to the Black Plague of the Middle Ages, from the effects of the horse messengers and trading caravans of the Mongol empires on the spread of infectious illnesses to the ecological impact of medical science after 1700, McNeill outlines a sweeping historical drama in this eminently readable and thought-provoking book.",

They nurture and protect them with love, luck, and courage. Strange dangers rear their heads, but the man and woman remain steadfast in their devotion to their accidental infants. Laura Krauss Melmed has told her beautiful story so well—in the imagery, rhythms, and resonance of a true fairy tale—that one turns the pages both awed and overjoyed. Jim LaMarche’s paintings are perfectly matched to the tenor of the tale. The Rainbabies is the kind of book that stays in a family across the generations.",

On board the Pequod, a ship that sets off from Nantucket, our narrator Ishmael and his fellow crewmen think they are in the business of hunting whales for oil. But Captain Ahab, the ship’s grim, peg-legged skipper, has other ideas: He is out for revenge on the white whale who bit off his limb. His obsessive hunt for Moby-Dick will occupy him and the rest of the crew until the novel’s end—but not before Melville takes us on an imaginative voyage that is at once a seafaring thriller, a workplace comedy (complete with scenes of grizzled sailors harvesting whale sperm), and an almost Shakespearean dramatization of man’s fate.",

But what you might never imagine is how these disparate events, notions, and personalities could be woven into a penetrating, sagacious, compelling story, which is just what Louis Menand has done in his vivid account of the development of the philosophical school of pragmatism, an “idea about ideas” that would define America’s empirically minded encounter with modernity by insisting that the meaning of a proposition or action was not preexisting, but was defined by its observable consequences.",

The range of subjects is astonishing: political conventions, crime and punishment, morals, government, democracy, music, literature, history, and the South, with keen comment on leaders from Lincoln to FDR, writers from Poe to Dreiser to Conrad, personalities from Walt Whitman to Rudolph Valentino, and composers from Beethoven to Wagner to both Johann and Richard Strauss. Throughout the book’s more than six hundred pages, Mencken’s distinctive style is matched by his singular wit.",

Floating on an undercurrent of footnotes as amusing as they are abundant, Merton’s discourse rushes ahead, doubles back, takes off in a dozen directions in history, literature, science, and sociology. It is abstruse and whimsical, parodic and pedantic; it is replete with insight into creativity, tradition, the transmission of knowledge, and the social context of discovery. OTSOG is sui generis, a stupendous roller coaster of a book, vertiginous in its passage, secure on its track. As Michael Dirda has perfectly put it, “Once people used to ask if such and such was ‘funny ha-ha’ or ‘funny peculiar.’ On the Shoulders of Giants is all the more wondrous for being, deliciously, delightfully, both.” ",

        "text": "Thomas Merton is one of the most intriguing spiritual figures of the twentieth century. An enormously talented writer possessed of a bohemian temperament, a prodigious literary energy, and a searching mind, he retreated from the world in his early twenties, giving his spiritual restlessness a forbidding and yet ultimately freeing destination: a Trappist monastery in Kentucky. From the solitude of the Abbey of Gethsemani, he paradoxically attracted worldwide celebrity, becoming through the 1950s and 1960s an influential, esteemed, and at times controversial advocate of peace and social justice. Laced with wry humor, informed with an erudition that stretches from Duns Scotus’s proof of the existence of God to the novels of D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Merton’s narrative of his peripatetic life in this world—in France, England, and Rome, at Cambridge’s Clare College and Columbia University, in upstate New York and other locales—is sustained with qualities of intelligence, struggle, and devotion that enhance the wonder of its earnestness. His discovery of his vocation as a priest, and its ultimate unexpected destination, is described with a freshness that continues to open a window for readers on the alluring and mysteriously rewarding austerities of the contemplative life.",

Was it all the fault of the British commanders, such as the much-vilified generals Douglas Haig and Henry Rawlinson? Were the soldiers themselves at least in part to blame, since so many persisted in what had quickly revealed itself to be a suicide mission? For answers to these and the many other questions raised by the events of that July day beside the Somme River in northern France, the place to turn is this riveting, meticulously detailed, and deeply affecting account of the staggering tragedy. Drawing on sources ranging from official reports to interviews with hundreds of survivors, Martin Middlebrook not only explains, hour by hour, how the debacle unfolded, but also puts the battle into perspective in terms of the entire First World War.",

        "text": "This hardheaded yet incantatory novel, full of desert sunlight, dust, and spartan, censer-plumed chambers, opens more than half a millennium after a nuclear holocaust has plunged mankind back into the Dark Ages. In the American Southwest, the monks of the Abbey of the Blessed Leibowitz struggle to preserve the rare and incomprehensible documents that have survived the scathing Simplification, a period in which not just learning but literacy itself has been disdained and persecuted. The abbey is named for its founder, a Jewish electrical engineer in the American military who converted to Roman Catholicism and, in the wake of that now distant nuclear catastrophe, established a monastic order dedicated to hiding books and protecting scientific knowledge. Six hundred years later, the novice Brother Francis stumbles upon a cache of ancient documents and relics from the holy Leibowitz, and eventually travels to New Rome to be present for Leibowitz’s elevation to sainthood. Miller’s tone throughout his recursively calamitous chronicle is alternately coolly ironic, despairing, affirmative, and resigned. The eternal parade of human folly—man as God made him, mitigated only by faith and education—gets the full scrutiny of his gimlet eye. Still, Miller’s vision of cloistered savants struggling to maintain and transmit civilization amidst ineluctable chaos speaks to the most noble and altruistic impulses of the human soul.",

It was the genius of A. A. Milne, observing his own son, Christopher, playing with his teddy bear, to immortalize such childhood inspiration in affectionate tales that are among the most endearing in all children’s literature. It’s hard to imagine better bedside reading for parents and tots than these celebrations of companionship and fanciful but nevertheless unconditional love. If they’re lucky, young listeners will live to discover—when the time has come for them to read to their own little ones—that days spent in the Hundred Acre Wood with Winnie and Christopher Robin can return after decades with all their tenderness and wonder intact.",

        "text": "A tale of forbidden fruit, Paradise Lost can be a forbidding poem, for it advances dense theological arguments about temptation, sin, predestination, and punishment in language that is radically unlike modern English: Milton’s unrhymed pentameter lines, populated with an esoteric, Latinate vocabulary that can make even Shakespeare seem conversational, defy casual reading. In its early episodes, as it makes its serpentine way to the Garden of Eden to recount Eve and Adam’s fall from grace, the poem passes through an imaginative terrain that invests ideas of rebellion, fate, and free will with brilliant colors. In fact, Milton’s artistic engagement with these themes overwhelms the certainties of any dogma, until the reader feels their metaphysical force as an almost physical presence. Milton’s epic resounds with a majesty no other work in the language approaches; to feel its power one must speak it aloud, letting the sounds orchestrate the intricate sense into a melody beyond explanation, a kind of swelling reality that transports us from heaven and hell to the human world, just as Adam and Eve, at the poem’s close, set out toward history from the realms of myth.",

        "text": "Born and raised in Bombay but a longtime resident of Canada, a Parsi rather than a Hindu, a realist in an age of magic realists, Rohinton Mistry has never neatly fit expectations. The tightly focused artistry of his first two works of fiction, Tales from Firozsha Baag and Such a Long Journey, gave no hint of the capacious creative vision his third book, A Fine Balance, would exhibit, earning him comparison to Dickens, Tolstoy, and—by one astute critic, at least—the Victor Hugo of Les Misérables. The character-centric plot is enlivened by the author’s ability to imbue his realism with close observation of suffering and attentive celebration of the infinite variety of facts and faces that populate the world. Mistry’s alertness to forces of history and the legacy of social and political oppression, his compassion for the downtrodden and unlucky, and, most importantly, his fidelity to human truths that transcend caste and circumstance to inform the most circumscribed lives with joy, sorrow, grief, and love—all testify to the justness of the invocation of past masters when discussing A Fine Balance. They translate into a reading experience that is filled with the transporting wonder only the greatest novels inspire.",

If things were this bad in the 70's in India, it makes me wonder if there has been any improvement since. One thing I found very interesting was initially Dina was prejudiced against Ishvar and Om. Maneck was friends with them while Dina wanted him to maintain his distance. Maneck helped Dina  see some things she thought were insulting. Then she really felt it when Ishvar fell on his knees before her. She initially let them stay on the veranda to keep them out of police hands. The 4 of them ended up living together in peace and even having fun. At the end of the book, Dina still sees Ishvar and Om even though they are now beggars and asks Maneck to wait he won't. He no longer wants to associate with them.",

        "text": "Of all the legendary scribes whose prose graced the columns of The New Yorker in its heyday, Joseph Mitchell is in a class by himself. His profiles of his preferred subjects—in his own description, “visionaries, obsessives, imposters, fanatics, lost souls, the-end-is-near street preachers, old Gypsy kings and old Gypsy queens, and out-and-out freak-show freaks”—offered an unparalleled portrait of Manhattan’s human comedy, penned by an offbeat Balzac whose eyes and ears missed no trick. Mitchell’s encounters with eccentrics and hardworking joes in and around the metropolis are a joy to read, and a lesson in the arts of observation and composition. Whether writing about the Fulton Fish Market or McSorley’s Ale House on East Seventh Street, the author has a knack for knowing where to look, whom to engage in conversation, and how to listen; few writers short of Joyce have ever evoked the undercurrents of a city’s dynamism with Mitchell’s sense of scope and scrutiny. Although the labeling of his work as bona fide nonfiction has been questioned—he was not shy about creating composite characters or ordering facts more artfully than reality supplied them—the power of his stories to deliver human truths and literary delights in equal measure remains unassailable.",

Such is certainly the case with Gone With the Wind, which brings America’s bloodiest war—and the Southern privileges it vanquished—to life with irresistible power (albeit with a blinkered sense of moral responsibility and historical reality when it comes to the unprivileged and enslaved). Although it is filled with dozens of characters—from the noble but timid Ashley Wilkes to the blustering but stalwart maid Mammy—it is Scarlett’s book, and the combination of scheming, seduction, and sheer will by which she survives the collapse of her way of life makes her a heroine with few peers in American literature.",

        "text": "There is no certainty about who wrote the Gita, or when; scholars have dated it anywhere between the third century BC and the sixth century of the modern era. At some point, it was incorporated into Hinduism’s mammoth epic, the Mahabharata, but it appears to have been written later than the rest of the larger work. In any case, the Gita is a self-contained, complete, and wholly satisfying reading experience in its own right, and is often published separately. Replete with quotable wisdom, its verses have traveled far and wide: Thoreau brought a copy with him to Walden Pond, and when physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer recalled observing the explosion of the first atomic bomb outside of Alamogordo, New Mexico, in 1945, he invoked Krishna’s description of himself as “the destroyer of worlds.” The poem possesses an epigrammatic eloquence that makes its guidance applicable cross-culturally: “Set thy heart upon thy work, but never on its reward,” is a key precept of its teaching, as is “ . . . do thy duty, even if it be humble, rather than another’s, even if it be great.”",

A forthright, poignant, and highly amusing memoir, it reveals what a “rich vein of lunacy” ran in the Mitford family and what an isolated and eccentric upbringing the children had before embarking on their respective headline-grabbing misadventures. From the whirl of the London social season (Unity, by the way, was known to bring her pet rat to fancy dances) to Miami’s Bar Roma, which Jessica and her first husband ran for a time, Hons and Rebels reads—as one British reviewer aptly put it—“like extravagantly mannered fiction, except that it is all fabulously true.” It offers a lively look at the wild side of the English upper crust.",

The Pursuit of Love is particularly wicked for its thinly veiled portrait of Mitford’s own extravagantly eccentric family, disguised here as the Radletts, who live at Alconleigh, an estate deep in the English countryside. The blustering father and the vague but doting mother keep ineffectual watch over their seven children as well as their niece Fanny, who narrates the story. For the record, Fanny is being raised by her aunt and uncle because her own stylish parents are just too glamorous for child rearing. Displaying Mitford’s addictively readable prose and her genius for satirizing aristocratic life as it was lived in the years between the world wars, The Pursuit of Love is sparkling entertainment.",

        "text": "Despite the fact that it was the first novel by an American Indian to win a Pulitzer Prize, and that it sparked what has come to be known as the Native American Renaissance, House Made of Dawn, in its outline, at least, relates a tale of alienation and discontent that is not uncommon in the annals of modern fiction. What distinguishes N. Scott Momaday’s debut work is the manner of its telling, which intertwines the plight of its young American Indian protagonist with his culture’s traditions, myths, and modes of apprehending both natural and spiritual experience. Told in shifting time frames, House Made of Dawn is the story of a Tano Indian named Abel. Returning home from his World War II army service, Abel finds himself torn between the world he grew up in—his grandfather’s world—and the sparkling promise of postwar America. The former, defined by the limits of the reservation and the limitless legacy of ancient wisdom, is spiritually rich but materially poor, while the latter is filled with the allure of seductive freedoms. Drawn to urban life, divorced from the communion with the land and the traditions of his heritage, Abel pursues an aimless life that leads to prison, dissipation, and despair. With the final illness and death of his grandfather, Abel embraces the rituals that have long connected the Tano living to their dead. As he struggles toward consolation and new hope, the author raises his language to an incantatory, elegiac pitch that is transporting.",

Despite its daunting heft and its status as a classic, the Essays makes forgiving reading; you really can open it anywhere and find reward. Whether you read it with discipline or by the light of serendipity, you’re bound to discover some private value in Montaigne’s meditations.",

But the child who arrives from the orphanage in Nova Scotia is not a boy, as they expected, but a spirited and imaginative eleven-year-old girl. Once the shock wears off, Matthew and Marilla adapt to the surprise—which proves good practice, since Anne will continue to deliver surprises to their doorstep on an almost daily basis (as in the famous episode in which Anne dyes her hair green). From its first long, intricately constructed sentence, which combines a storytelling intimacy with sophisticated attention to character and setting (and leaves you eager to hear what happens next), Anne of Green Gables balances its innocent cheerfulness with an appraising intelligence that has a lot to tell readers young and old about human nature—and about the sympathy and generosity good books can breed.",

The present Emperor’s heir is Juille, a daughter determined her dynasty will continue. Against the machinations of Ericon’s living deities, to say nothing of the wishes of her doddering father, she wages a one-woman campaign to save all that her ancestors built. Moore veers from the cosmic to the intimate with breathtaking authority, amplifying the enveloping power of her storytelling—and the compelling character of her heroine.",

Informed by influences including surrealism, the fiction of her husband, Alberto Moravia, and the work of Katherine Mansfield, which Morante had translated while hiding out in the mountains south of Rome with Moravia during the Nazi occupation of the city, History is a sprawling narrative infused with moral outrage. By making one woman’s harrowing fate both gripping and indelible, Elsa Morante composed what Alfred Kazin rightly called “one of the few novels in any language that renders the full horror of Hitler’s war, the war that never gets in the books.”",

        "text": "When we meet Roger Mifflin at the beginning of Parnassus on Wheels, he is navigating his horse-drawn wagon (called “Travelling Parnassus”) through the gate of  Helen McGill’s farm: “a queer wagon,” Helen informs us, “shaped like a van,” and sporting a sign advertising “Good Books for Sale: Shakespeare, Charles Lamb, R.L.S., Hazlitt, and All Others.” Inside are rows and rows of volumes old and new. “Lord!,” Roger tells Helen, “when you sell a man a book you don’t sell him just twelve ounces of paper and ink and glue—you sell him a whole new life.” And a “whole new life” is just what Travelling Parnassus delivers to Helen McGill in this captivating comedy, as Mifflin—a self-described “bald-headed fool over forty selling books on a country road”—inspires in her a happy revolt from her normal routine. Originally published in 1917, Christopher Morley’s first love letter to the traffic in books remains a transporting entertainment, laced with literary lore and the names of enticing volumes.\n\nIts sequel, The Haunted Bookshop, which appeared two years later, finds Mifflin and McGill, married and ensconced in Brooklyn, having settled their volumes in a shop called Parnassus at Home. The rollicking plot, in which an ambitious young advertising man woos a comely young heiress by doggedly uncovering the designs of foreign agents operating down the block from Mifflin’s den of serenity, provides amusing diversion while allowing more room for Mifflin (and Morley) to expound on the intrigue and intricacy of the bookseller’s art.\n\nTogether, this pair of tales perfectly captures the mysterious allure of dusty old bookshops, which, despite the efficiencies of superstores and the internet, all booklovers are likely to treasure still.\n",

        "text": "Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) was the twenty-sixth president of the United States. He remains our youngest chief executive (he was forty-two when he assumed the office upon the assassination of President McKinley), and he is certainly one of the most fascinating. Naturalist John Burroughs once said of his friend “T. R.” that he was a “many-sided man, and every side was like an electric battery.” In the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, acclaimed biographer Edmund Morris covers the unflaggingly energetic pre-presidential years of this dynamo. Morris makes the most of his rich material, orchestrating vast stores of incident and information into an engaging narrative that is a joy to read. He makes the force of T. R.’s larger-than-life presence felt in each of the varied contexts Roosevelt so vigorously dominated, illuminating as well the complicated character behind the trademark caricature—pince-nez, heavy mustache, dazzlingly big teeth—that history has handed down as his enduring image. Along the way, Morris also draws a detailed portrait of the age.",

Abetted by a handful of crafty and colorful local partisans, the author and his comrade succeed in executing their mission, seizing Kreipe at gunpoint, then escaping through the Cretan foothills and across the Mediterranean to British-occupied Egypt, their German captive in tow. Moss’s firsthand account of his 1944 adventure is a vivid diary of a remarkable feat of daring. That his colleague in the plot is one of the masters of modern English prose, Patrick Leigh Fermor, adds literary interest to his gripping tale; Fermor’s own account of aspects of the adventure, Abducting a General, appeared in 2014.",

In 1869, a sheep owner named Delaney offered Muir a job that gave him the opportunity of spending the summer in “the high, cool, green pastures of the Sierra.” Muir eagerly accepted Delaney’s offer, and the diary he kept during the three and a half months he spent in the mountains forms the bulk of My First Summer in the Sierra, an early reflection of Muir’s awestruck reverence for the glories of the Earth that belongs among the classics of nature writing.",

Ingenuity and serendipity alike are celebrated, and blind alleys in the laboratory and bad judgments in public policy are explained with insight and valuable interpretation. Because of Mukherjee’s rare combination of clinical intelligence, intellectual curiosity, and imaginative intuition, The Emperor of All Maladies does justice to the true life-and-death dimensions of its subject. A nearly five-hundred-page tome about the most fearsome of diseases may sound like a gloomy prospect, but this “biography” of cancer is a marvel of medical erudition, emotional gravity, and literary elegance: Our scientific learning and human understanding are so enhanced by its narrative that we’re sorry to come to its end.

        "text": "A novel set at the end of World War II, The Hunger Angel details a forgotten chapter of twentieth-century history: the deportation of Germans living in Eastern Europe to work in Soviet forced-labor camps. Leo, the book’s young narrator, is at first almost excited to be expelled from his “thimble of a town, where every stone had eyes.” But the labor camp, where he is required to shovel coal and compelled to scrounge for anything to eat, is far more brutal than he could have imagined. Leo is gay and knows he’ll be killed if his secret is found out, but in truth he has barely any sexual desires at all. Müller’s narrative of the realities of the camps has power in itself, but what makes The Hunger Angel unforgettable is the gravity and uncanny grace of its expressionistic, beautifully knotty prose—“a kind of Habsburg German,” as the author herself describes it, infused with Romanian elements and studded with invented words.",

        "text": "Just as William Faulkner did with his fictional Yoknapatawpha County, Alice Munro has spent most of her career writing about a single place, her native western Ontario. It was, in Munro’s youth, at least, a place of small towns, religious probity, and strict standards of behavior—the sort of place that may have little fun for a child but proved to be fertile imaginative terrain for a budding writer. And just like Faulkner, if without the formal pyrotechnics and Southern Gothic intoxication, Munro discovers, through the close and empathetic observation of ordinary and deeply fallible people, more profundity than most authors could find in a teeming metropolis. Her stories shuttle through time without warning; they often begin in the middle, then jump to the past before hurtling forward and back again. They can span decades, or focus on a single day. They exhibit abrupt, almost violent shifts in tone, sometimes in a single paragraph. What elevates them to such extraordinary heights is Munro’s acuity as an observer and a stylist, so subtle in each case that you may not grasp her art at first glance.",

Dick, and there’s more than a little Kafka in the air. Yet none of these analogs suggests the seamless weirdness that is Murakami’s alone; he creates a field of fantasy that is simultaneously familiar and eerily otherworldly, quick with humor and eroticism, alive with a literary static electricity whose shocks are peculiarly addictive. This energy pulses through Toru Okada’s bewildering odyssey in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, a quest that brings him into unexpected proximity to historical horrors (specifically those surrounding Japan’s brutal campaigns in Manchuria in the 1930s) and finds him spending a remarkable amount of rewarding time in the bottom of an empty well (you’ll be surprised at how intriguing you may find it, too).",

What can’t be denied, however, is something even more astonishing: The book seems to encompass in its one thousand pages a history of the form as it would unfold in the future. Beginning in a fairy-tale realm, its storytelling passes through uninhabited countries on the continent of fiction that will not be settled for several centuries; it ventures through the romance and the picaresque to discover the domestic, social, and psychological novel before any of these would be imagined by another writer. The massive Tale contains two distinct parts: The first, more than twice as long as the second, concerns the life and many loves of a handsome prince named Genji; the second part of the enormous pageant is focused on two young men—Kaoru, born to one of Genji’s wives (although he is not the prince’s son), and Niou, Genji’s grandson—and traces the dramatic twists in their ill-starred infatuations with three sisters.",

Although he’d always said he would retire once he was past sixty, his friends, colleagues, and sundry lovers are surprised when he says goodbye to the bright lights and settles himself into a little house on an ugly stretch of coast (the better to keep tourists away). Vowing to be a better man than he has been and bent on reflection to that end, it is his intent to write a memoir. But it’s delightfully clear from the moment he puts pen to page that he’s too charmed by his every thought and action to see beyond the vanity each moment allows, and his document immediately turns from memoir to diary, recording the visitors, sea monsters, and obsessions that descend upon his seaside retreat. Soon enough, however, fortune delivers the past to his present in the form of Hartley, the lost adolescent sweetheart who has matured into a stout old woman who hasn’t given Arrowby a thought in decades. Undeterred by reality, Arrowby conjures romance and recaptured youth, kidnapping Hartley and casting her into a supporting role in his star vehicle. The story careers from naturalism to supernaturalism, from comedy to melodrama and back again, as Murdoch shepherds a large cast of players across Arrowby’s stage in a fleetly amusing literary performance.",

        "text": "Robert Musil’s vast, unfinished novel is one of the twentieth century’s most esteemed works of fiction. From its opening paragraph, Musil’s distinctive style alerts us to the playful and peculiar attributes of his intelligence. In a tone simultaneously learned and lampooning, Musil describes the weather in intricate scientific detail (with reference to barometric pressure, isotherms and isotheres, the movements of the planets, and more), only to conclude with the simple experiential reality: “It was a fine day in August 1913.” So ambitious in its scope that its ultimate incompletion seems a foregone conclusion, The Man Without Qualities has often been hailed as the equal of Joyce’s Ulysses and Proust’s In Search of Lost Time. But, lacking the formal rigor of the first and the aesthetic coherence of the second, its richness is of a different order. An intellectual engine that never comes to rest, Musil’s masterpiece is alive with a play of erudition, insight, and acuity that, paragraph by paragraph, is its own unparalleled reward.",

For Lolita isn’t about a man who just “liked” young girls: It is, in fact, about a thirty-seven-year-old named Humbert Humbert who has an extended sexual relationship with a twelve-year-old named Dolores Haze. (“She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.”) Put like this, the story sounds repellent. And yet Lolita has not only survived the outrage and sold many millions of copies but has also established itself as one of the most lavishly praised literary works of the twentieth century.\n",

They would arrive each Thursday morning, remove the black chadors required by the government for women in public, and explore the precincts of Lolita, Pride and Prejudice, and other Western novels. Written after she had left Iran for the United States in 1997, Nafisi’s memoir of these gatherings, as well as of her years as a student and a teacher in her native land, is both a telling personal testament and a moving group portrait of women trapped in the emotional and political conundrums provoked by the prescriptions of the Islamic Revolution. Her “memoir in books” is a human story, peopled with characters whose hearts and minds we come to care about; it is, in the end, an altogether astonishing account of how literature can illuminate a private path to meaning even in the most benighted circumstances.",

She just seems to believe the plight of the other women in the story somehow raise the banal details of her career and apartment to a level we should be glad to hear about them all.

V. S. Naipaul relates Biswas’s wayward pursuit of autonomy with such vivid and unsentimental attention to the cares and comedy of human relations that the novel transcends its West Indian milieu, delivering truths that are funny, poignant, painful, and universal. Infused with a simple man’s wish to make a home for himself in this homeless world, A House for Mr. Biswas teems with complicated life. It is Naipaul’s most loved, as well as one of his most lauded, books; the word “masterpiece” is often—rightly—used to describe it.",

His work was original and varied: He was a pioneer of game theory and differential geometry, and his ideas have proved relevant to subjects that range from artificial intelligence to markets and money to military decision-making. But beginning in 1959, paranoid schizophrenia crippled Nash’s “beautiful mind” for decades, wreaking havoc with his public and private life in ways that Sylvia Nasar describes with intelligence and sympathy in A Beautiful Mind. This dramatic life story includes a stunning final act: Inexplicably, in about 1989, Nash began to show signs of recovery and started doing significant mathematics again.

        "text": "“No one cries when a street dies,” writes Gloria Naylor in the epilogue to this searing novel, encapsulating the material and emotional emptiness that is often the legacy of complex dilemmas—political, economic, ethical, personal—too often simplified by the impoverishment of inner cities. Seven interlocking stories detail how several African American women come to find themselves on Brewster Place, revealing the loves and losses—of children, husbands, partners, futures, pasts—that hold them there. Together, the episodes explore the realms of emotion that transcend their urban environs, even as they animate, then come to haunt, Naylor’s dying street.\n",

        "text": "This very funny book is an irresistible example of a characteristically English genre: You might call it the “Wacky but Intrepid School of Travel Writing.” Books belonging to this happy group feature improbable travelers who embark, usually with little or no planning, on arduous journeys through remote and perilous regions. Newby’s jolly narrative begins in a London fitting room, where he is at work as a not-very-successful salesman for a women’s fashion designer. Nurturing a secret longing to explore “unknown territory” (and escape the Fashion Industry in general and the Spring Collection in particular), he fires off a telegram to a friend at the British embassy in Rio de Janeiro. One thing quickly leads to another, and soon Newby and his pal find themselves—after four days of “climbing lessons,” if that’s what you can call ambling over gentle slopes in Wales—in a remote and perilous region indeed: the Hindu Kush of northeastern Afghanistan. There, the fearsome peaks of the Nuristan range dare them to ascend. The narrative fares better than the travelers, building a steady comic momentum that is all the more entertaining for its detailed tabulation of their mishaps and mistakes.",

        "text": "On the morning of May 30, 1593, a businessman named Ingram Frizer met with three other men at a lodging house in Deptford, England. They spent the day quietly, but in the evening an argument broke out and Frizer stabbed one of his companions several times, killing him. The dead man was playwright Christopher Marlowe, author of Tamburlaine the Great, Dr. Faustus, and The Jew of Malta. In The Reckoning, his ingenious literary-historical detective story, Charles Nicholl demonstrates that once you start looking into the “great reckoning in a little room” (Shakespeare’s sly allusion, in As You Like It, to his fellow writer’s bloody fate), you find yourself drawn into the complicated treacheries of the Elizabethan underworld. Nicholl is peerless at breathing vibrant life into exhaustive research, and in this Elizabethan thriller he has pieced together an exceptionally satisfying narrative, rich in its detailed evocation of sixteenth-century England and filled with a colorful gallery of writers, wits, spies, government ministers, “intelligencers,” and “conny catchers.” Crime solving never gets more literate than this, nor does literary history ever get more gripping.",

The bag contained a substantial piece of autobiographical writing, penned when Sackville-West was twenty-eight, describing—perhaps attempting to fathom is a better way to put it—her desperate passion for another woman, Violet Trefusis. Sackville-West’s own account makes up parts 1 and 3 of Portrait of a Marriage, and it bears witness to her gifts as one of the finest prose writers of her generation. Parts 2 and 4 contain her son’s commentary on the affair and its repercussions, drawing on the letters of his mother and father as well as on the recollections of those who knew them; his skill as a biographer is put to judicious and compelling use. The final section of the book deals with the remaining years of their marriage, showing, in the younger Nicolson’s words, “how my parents’ love for each other survived all further threats to it.”",

This is one of them. The Birth of Tragedy is an important contribution to the history of ideas. It is also crucial to understanding the development of Nietzsche’s thought. Yet the main reason it remains a thrilling experience for general readers is that Nietzsche’s live-wire prose conveys the excitement of intellectual discovery, affording them an electrifying sense of what it’s like to contemplate a subject from a revolutionary angle, to grasp its complexities in a way no one previously has.",

        "text": "“Imagination is not a gift usually associated with bureaucracies,” asserts the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks\nUpon the United States late in its report, noting the failure of vision that had prevented America from foreseeing the threat that precipitated the horrible events of September 11, 2001. One might say with equal certainty that literary quality is not a characteristic usually associated with government documents, yet not the least of the astonishments this book contains is what Publishers Weekly aptly called its “absolutely compelling narrative intelligence.” Despite the weight of its research and investigative findings, despite the detail of its assemblage of policy and intelligence data, The 9/11 Commission Report has a suspenseful, relentless forward motion that makes it nearly impossible to put down. Although further information has already broadened our understanding of the threat of terrorism, it is unlikely that such knowledge—or revelations still to come—will alter the compelling interest of this remarkable historical document.\n",

Of the numerous accounts—documentary, historical, speculative, and fictional—that have been written, the best and most popular is the novelization by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. Published in 1932, Mutiny on the Bounty imagines the voyage out, the months in Tahiti, and the eventual uprising. Although this telling may not be the most historically accurate, it is the perfect introduction to an endless shelf of reading about a historical event. One of the great seafaring tales of all time, the story, like Shackleton’s Endurance voyage, has assumed the aura of a modern myth.",

That a series steeped in naval adventure begins with chamber music is a telling indication of the wit and sophistication of the Aubrey/Maturin novels. The contrast between the men’s characters and interests (encompassing music, food, poetry, science, and natural history) provides a substantial foundation upon which O’Brian erects exciting plots of dangerous action. In Master and Commander and all the books that follow, authentic details of life aboard a man-of-war in Commodore Nelson’s navy are admirably rendered, and the author’s narrative skills deftly convey the excitement of ships closing in battle.",

The novel moves with startling speed and surety from the lovely lanes of Irish provincial life into the bloodstained terrain of the Balkan War, spinning a web of fear, violence, and displacement as human decency is driven from domestic certainty and transformed into something lost and wandering. O’Brien’s novel evolves from fairy tale to parable to historical tragedy as it marks the way stations of the refugees, real and metaphorical, whom the author honors with vivid elegy: “Nobodies, mere numbers on paper or computer, the hunted, the haunted, the raped, the defeated, the mutilated, the banished, the flotsam of the world, unable to go home, wherever home is.” Reaching for beauty from roots of terror, The Little Red Chairs reads like a sacrament, with all the uncanny truths and consequences a sacrament invokes.",

The Things They Carried straddles the approaches of the earlier volumes, and in so doing amplifies their power. O’Brien’s narratives are both searing and fleeting, faithful to the urgency with which all of us, not only soldiers, struggle to hold on to whatever we carry in the only way we really can, trying to save our lives with stories.

Perhaps it’s because she\nraised peacocks at her home in Milledgeville, Georgia, or because of the somehow defiantly settled life she led there with her mother. Perhaps it is the crippling effects of the lupus she endured throughout her writing life, until her death at age thirty-nine. Perhaps it is her fierce Catholicism, through which she viewed human existence with a lack of sentiment that might have scared both Hemingway and Mickey Spillane, to say nothing of priests or even popes. Her stories are not parables, though they are often labeled as such. They are more like savage rites, their significance in some ways closer to Greek tragedy than Southern Gothic. Although the larger-than-life heroes of the former have been replaced by the flesh-and-blood figures of the latter, dispossessed and often desperate, the characters are still called to account by inscrutable forces of fate and suffering—which, O’Connor might say, are emblems of God’s mysterious ways.",

They have the intimate, lived-in, and conspiratorial air that envelops any close exchange between speaker and listener, and they are animated with the energies—and frequently the humor—of living speech. As Richard Ellmann expertly notes in his introduction to this volume, O’Connor’s stories “pass into our experience like incidents we have ourselves known or almost known,” broadening our understanding of fate and family, life, love, and death. The power of their magnanimous scrutiny of mundane affairs is old-fashioned in its way, and timeless.",

With poet James Fenton and three native guides, he ventured, on foot and by boat, into the center of Borneo on an ultimately futile search for a rare two-horned rhinoceros. Here, though, is the most remarkable thing about O’Hanlon’s account of the two-month journey: It’s as hilarious as it is scarifying. Knockabout farce enlivens practically every grueling step. When, for instance, the worn-out, beat-up expedition finally reaches its destination, the party celebrates by teaching a tricky disco move to friendly Ukit tribesmen. No wonder the legendary traveler Eric Newby called Into the Heart of Borneo “certainly the funniest travel book I have ever read.”",

The greatest American play ever? Perhaps. But this much is for sure: Long Day’s Journey into Night is the play that established once and for all that American drama deserved a celebrated role on the stage of world literature.",

There is little in Dreams from My Father to suggest that, just thirteen years after its publication, its author would be standing on the steps of the Capitol and taking the oath of office as the first black president of the United States. Nevertheless, the book stands on its own as one of the finest memoirs by any American writer on the resonance of racial differences and the journey of self-discovery these differences can shape.\n",

His treatise is to the tea ceremony as the ceremony itself is to Japanese life: an encapsulation of aesthetic, philosophic, and even moral ideals, “a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.” Filled with quotable sentences, The Book of Tea is as much about East versus West and old versus new as it is about tea. Though a mere sixty-five pages, it is brewed with enough intellect and wisdom to inform a lifetime’s meditation.",

That road runs through the center of Ben Okri’s novel, a work of eerie beauty and, despite the book’s supernatural compass, extraordinary fidelity to fundamental human emotions. Give in to the current of the author’s musical prose and otherworldly visions and you are in for a transformative reading experience. Okri’s book is bigger than life in just the way that, deep in our hearts, we know our lives are bigger than circumstantial evidence suggests.",

The heart’s inventiveness in turning such anguish inward, allowing it to infiltrate conscience as well as consciousness, seems limitless, even though words are seldom a match for its true character. A slim collection of four stories, Tillie Olsen’s Tell Me a Riddle is animated by speech rhythms, its narratives carried along on fits and starts of thoughts and ellipses of memory and emotion. Its genius is the way its prose conveys the abiding argument we have with our own failings and feelings and with the needs, demands, and affections of those closest to us. Olsen unflinchingly evokes profound emotions in a way that leaves the reader disturbed and humbled by something like the catharsis a tragic drama can deliver. ",

Onians provides fodder for hours, days, and months of speculation and reflection. It would be a fine companion for a castaway. In fact, one might even say that The Origins of European Thought itself describes its own desert island game, played by our species from our earliest consciousness: Adrift on our planet, alone with their thoughts, the imaginative among our forebears would pass the eons trying to comprehend the most enticing and endlessly unknowable—the most obvious and the most mysterious—themes of our existence: life, death, mind, body, soul, time, fate. What Onians does, in this unique, learned, stimulating, odd, and absorbing exploration, is report on the first few rounds of this pastime, plumbing depths of linguistic, literary, and archaeological evidence (predominantly, but not entirely, from Greece and Rome) to illuminate the early shape of humanity’s answers to eternal questions—answers that continue to cast powerful shadows on all our wanderings and wonderings.",

She grew up at the Villa Medici in Fiesole, and came to Val d’Orcia upon her marriage to an Italian marquis. At their manor, La Foce, the Origos created a world of learning (she authored several splendid scholarly biographies), labor, and compassion, improving the land and the life of its natives. But neither their privilege nor their location spared them from the fears, perils, and uncertainties of wartime life, as this personal record proves. Surprising and poignant incidents are recounted again and again in this remarkable diary, which documents, with immediacy and no little eloquence, life in a remote area of the Tuscan countryside during eighteen months of the Second World War, from January 1943 through July 1944. The ordinary tasks of living get harder by the day as the conflict closes in, while Iris’s concern for the safety of the young refugees from Genoa and Turin who are in her charge grows greater. One of the most remarkable records of the experience of noncombatants during World War II, War in Val d’Orcia is a testament to the nobility of “the shared, simple acts of everyday life,” even—especially—in the face of destruction and death.",

Orwell’s warning of a spiritless, totalitarian time to come has lost none of its relevance. It would be hard to name another twentieth-century novel whose coinages have so successfully infiltrated our language and, therefore, our grasp of the reality we inhabit. What is finally most chilling about 1984 is not its prescience about the dangers of totalitarianism, but rather its insight into the fragile qualities of mind, heart, and culture that we treasure as the surest manifestations of human nature. Tellingly, when Orwell finished the work in manuscript, he hesitated between the title he finally gave it and \"The Last Man in Europe.\"",

The four volumes, which are available separately, are: An Age Like This, 1920–1940; My Country Right or Left, 1940–1943; As I Please, 1943–1945; and In Front of Your Nose, 1945–1950. In her introduction, Sonia Orwell writes that in these pages, which mix political and literary matters, “what we really hear is the sound of a personal voice, an individual talking at random of the things that concern him on many different levels.” The result for readers, as we move from letter to review to essay to weekly newspaper column, is one of the most fascinating engagements with a working writer we’re likely to discover. Among the correspondence with publishers and commissioning editors (replete with bracing alertness to the need to pay the bills) there are marvelous musings on coffee and cigarettes, the vagaries of book reviewing, and how to make a proper cup of tea. There are also expositions of political realities, advocacy of (largely left-wing) causes, and reflections on crises from the Spanish Civil War to the Battle of Britain. ",

There are also expositions of political realities, advocacy of (largely left-wing) causes, and reflections on crises from the Spanish Civil War to the Battle of Britain. On literary themes, we find analyses ephemeral and enduring on subjects as diverse as Dickens, Kipling, Henry Miller, and P. G. Wodehouse. Last, but by no means least, these volumes contain some of the finest essays in English literature, including “Shooting an Elephant,” “My Country Right or Left,” “Politics and the English Language,” “Reflections on Gandhi,” and “Such, Such Were the Joys.” The different forms of prose make these volumes rewarding to read straight through and even more of a pleasure to pick up and browse at whim.

Echo and Narcissus, Pentheus and Bacchus, Pyramus and Thisbe, Perseus, Tiresias, Jason and Medea, Pygmalion, Adonis, Midas, to say nothing of the familiar gods and goddesses—no book has a grander cast than this fabulous poem, which marks humankind’s long graduation from myth to history. A great many of the tales Ovid relates are enchanting, and many have served as inspiration for artists from Chaucer and Shakespeare to Benjamin Britten and Jean Cocteau. Others are disconcerting in their sexual assumptions; love conquers all in Ovid, even the gods, and its conquests are often violent. Still, to read the Metamorphoses, even at random, is to enter an enduring landscape fed by waters of tragedy and comedy that, for all the poet’s fertile invention, seem drawn from the deepest, most unfathomable wells of human experience.

Assigned to teach English in the local school, the author receives an education that dwarfs the one he delivers to his Togolese students. Engaging Lavié’s inhabitants as he copes, or fails to, with his loneliness, anger, boredom, and fear, Packer portrays each encounter with a deft eye for the current moment but no illusion about the future that seems destined not to come. The author barely makes it through; in fact, he doesn’t last out his two-year Peace Corps commitment, and disappointment haunts him. Yet the eloquence of his witness redeems Packer in the reader’s eyes, if not his own. His embrace of the villagers’ experience, despite his realization that his intentions are, in the end, both inadequate and irrelevant to their fate, is poignantly true to the inscrutable present in which they live.",

The title refers to fifty-two manuscripts that were discovered in Egypt in 1945. These texts, known collectively as the Nag Hammadi Library, turned out to be the sacred writings of the Gnostics, an early Christian sect whose beliefs came in time to be judged as heretical by church authorities. Pagels shows that the writings of the Gnostics offer insights into the complexity of the fledgling Christian movement and its theological and political development. By bringing Gnostic doctrines to light, and presenting her scholarly findings with clarity and literary grace, Pagels provides an eye-opening reassessment of the origins of Christianity and the evolution of the church.",

Pagels traces the historical development of quantum theory from Einstein’s relativity through Heisenberg’s uncertainty and beyond (stopping, of course, to pet Schrödinger’s cat), then leads us deep into the “rational but not visualizable” intricacies of matter that quantum theory seeks to explain. The new picture of the material world he shares with us is both lucid and mind-bending, revealing an order in the behavior of the smallest particles that may indeed outline the architecture of the universe and provide a “unified field” for our conception of its progress from its first moments to its imagined end.",

You’re unlikely to find any books that convey the imaginative terrain of early years as vividly as these two lightly fictionalized memoirs of youth in Marseilles and, especially, summers in a Provençal village, written by the great French filmmaker Marcel Pagnol. My Father’s Glory and My Mother’s Castle are warm reminiscences in which Pagnol invites us to possess again the senses of welcome and of wonder that are childhood’s happiest promises. Although the books follow, more or less, a single chronological narrative, the dramatic focus shifts from one parent to the other just as the titles suggest. You’ll be sorry to surrender both—and the author’s good company—as you turn the last page. Fortunately, the story continues in two further volumes: The Time of Secrets and The Time of Love.",

Its first installment was published in 1865, its last in 1892, a year before Parkman’s death. Together the seven volumes of France and England in North America constitute what Parkman called “the history of the American forest”—a magnificent panorama of exploration, settlement, politics, and religion in which the wilderness itself is a forceful presence, something like the orchestra in a late Verdi opera—a brooding environment that shapes and subsumes the thrilling voices of the individual characters, a captivating cast of explorers, warriors, martyrs, and diplomats.",

        "text": "A child prodigy with a genius for mathematics and science, Blaise Pascal invented one of the earliest mechanical calculators. After a life-changing mystical religious experience in his early thirties, he devoted himself to theology and philosophy and produced two of the major works of seventeenth-century French literary prose. One is the Provincial Letters (1656–57), and the other is the Pensées, or Thoughts, a collection of notes for a project that was left unfinished at his death. The project was an apology for Christianity—an explanation and defense of the faith. Although the hundreds of brief texts that make up the Pensées are powerful as religious writings, they are also invaluable for their profound insight into the human condition—a condition, according to Pascal, defined by “inconstancy, boredom, unrest.” Throughout the Pensées, a twenty-first-century reader is likely to be struck by just how modern Pascal’s thinking seems, but on reflection, perhaps “timeless” is a better word. After all, the philosopher’s ruminations are nourished by the same anxiety the earliest humans might have experienced upon gazing into the night sky: “The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.”",

You should make no mistake about the rare reading experience Boris Pasternak’s novel offers: To get lost in its pages is to go beyond politics and glamour and encounter life itself in all its chaos and commotion, love and sorrow. On every page, Doctor Zhivago embraces the heedless rush of existence with an abandon at odds with the carefully calibrated artifice and ironic detachment of most modern fiction.",

The second book to feature his recurring hero, psychologist and policeman Alex Cross, Kiss the Girls (1955) is a catchy, compelling, and—it is about tracking a serial killer, after all—undeniably suspenseful tune.

Filled with dancing thoughts, provocative juxtapositions, and breathtaking leaps from everyday verities to eternal quandaries, Medieval in LA is light on its metaphorical feet, and a joy to ponder.

In the royalty of the genre, one might even see him as J. R. R. Tolkien’s dispossessed brother, ruling a realm wilder than the one the creator of The Lord of the Rings commanded.  But anyone of an expressive temperament or taste—admiring, say, the caricatural genius of Dickens and the inherent fatedness of Melville, or possessing a fondness for the Gothic or the baroque—will wander into Peake’s imaginative realm with wonder, and likely return to it again and again. In this trilogy, Gormenghast, a distant domain in the keeping of a noble family named Groan, is dominated by a vast and crumbling castle, a presence as unforgettable as any of the characters. Into this stony, tapestried, haunted demesne—self-sufficient and self-perpetuating, xenophobically tradition bound, its days marked with pointless rituals—is born Titus Groan, a star-crossed heir to the ancestral line. By the time we reach the end of the volume that bears his name, Titus is barely a toddler, but we have become fully enmeshed in the alliances and rivalries of Gormenghast, and seen Steerpike, the uncontainable ambitious kitchen boy, evolve from an innocuous lackey into a villainous power behind the throne, fueled with malice Shakespearean in its vivid characterization.

The difference is evident in their prose: Tolkien’s writing is sturdy and occasionally poetic, but it pales next to Peake’s idiosyncratic, virtuosic style. And where the former’s heart lay with salt-of-the-earth types like Bilbo Baggins, the latter’s allegiance was to eccentrics, artists, and rebels. Tolkien endorsed systems, hierarchies, and loyalties within both, while Peake railed against not only duties but against governance itself. Book two in Peake’s Gormenghast Trilogy follows Titus’s maturation and inevitable conflict with Steerpike. There is change and challenge, death and destruction, fire and flood and madness—leading ultimately to Titus’s revolt at the prospect of an eternity of “dead repetitions [and] moribund ceremonies.”",

What’s best and most absorbing about the Diary is its vivid personal scale: For example, Pepys’s unforgettable eyewitness account of the 1666 Great Fire of London—perhaps the most famous set piece in the entire chronicle—includes the detail that the diarist took time from his civic duties in the crisis to dig a pit to protect his papers, wine, and parmesan cheese from the rampaging flames.\n",

        "text": "I read the Le Gallienne abridged 1 volume version. I thought the book was a great read. it really showed how a common man lived in that era. One thing I found interesting was that every year he would take his books to be rebound if he was keeping them. He wanted them all to look the same. It made me think of the start of Masterpiece Theater on AMC. They have someone present the movie and he is sitting in a library where the books are all bound the same. The ones he didn't want to keep he treated like a paperback of today. He'd read part, tear it out and burn it.\nI did the same thing when I read the Bible. I have a good copy, but I also had a copy that was coming unbound. So I took the cover off, cut sections apart and put them in a quart Ziploc bag so they would stay together. I took one section, put it in my purse and read it. When I was finished, I threw it away. I kept doing that and I read the entire Bible in 15 months. I knew I finished it because there were no more sections to read. I do the same things with magazines when I take a plane ride. I bring several magazines I know I don't want to keep. Read & toss or give to someone else on the plane. As I travel my bag gets lighter and lighter. \nI also thought it interesting that he put himself on a budget and really cut down his entertainment expenses so he could save money to buy a house. \nI have told over 10 people about this book: one person said I should start a blog on what I read, and several others say it sound like a really good book and wrote the title down.

        "text": "Georges Perec was one of the leading members of Oulipo (“Ouvroir de littérature potentielle,” or “Workshop of potential literature”), a group of avant-garde European writers who, starting in the early 1960s, used rules, games, and mathematical analogies to generate verse and prose.  It’s said that Perec spent three years formulating the protocols that govern Life: A User’s Manual. But what’s amazing is that, in the final novel, those controls are nearly invisible: All the formal games cohere into a single, seamless product, generated through sophisticated rules but never diminished by them.   Although its compositional gymnastics might make you think that reading Life: A User’s Manual will be a pleasureless exertion, Perec’s singular accomplishment is to have created a huge and complex experimental novel that’s also a page-turner. Bursting with engaging characters and absorbing stories, this modern masterpiece allows us to see the infinite in the everyday, and the everyday in the infinite, too.\n",

Perelman himself inclined to a more jaundiced view of his accomplishments: “What Flaubert did to the French bourgeois in Bouvard and Pecuchet, what Pizarro did to the Incas, what Jack Dempsey did to Paolino Uzcudun, S. J. Perelman has done to American belles-lettres.” Most of the Most of S. J. Perelman is where a reader will find many of Perelman’s best comic sketches. The typically arresting titles—“Is There an Osteosynchrondroitrician in the House?” “Methinks He Doth Protein Too Much,” “De Gustibus Ain’t What Dey Used to Be”—demonstrate the author’s unique mix of street-corner patter, recherché vocabulary, and deliriously punning wordplay.",

        "text": "\nIn 1543, a Chinese cargo ship arrived in Japan. On board were three Portuguese adventurers. Two of them bore primitive firearms. As Noel Perrin tells it, at the moment when the feudal master Lord Tokitaka saw one of the Portuguese take aim and shoot a duck, “the gun enters Japanese history.” But three hundred years later, guns were almost unknown, and certainly unused, among the island’s populace. For reasons peculiar to their culture, the Japanese had reverted to the sword and bow. Perrin’s intriguing historical essay, covering the years 1543–1879 (a period coinciding, more or less, with Japan’s self-imposed isolation from the rest of the world), tells the story of this reversion—a surprising, rare instance of a nation successfully resisting technological advance for the sake of larger cultural concerns: symbolism, aesthetics, ideas of bravery and the dignity and skill of warriors. Good scholarship gives substance to Perrin’s fascinating tale, and his graceful, lucid writing makes reading Giving Up the Gun pure pleasure.",

But it’s not all flash; there’s intense engagement, too. Phillips’s writing is rigorous and profound without seeming to pursue either rigor or profundity as a destination. His essayistic path is agile rather than ponderous, an emergent process that allows the reader to share the energy and inspiration of his discoveries.    Nowhere are his gifts on better display than in The Beast in the Nursery, a book that presents an enlightening argument against the determinisms of science, and of religion, and of psychoanalysis, too, and in favor of the liberating reality of uncertain expectations.",

But in the course of their trip, Pirsig ruminates on fundamental philosophical matters in an effort “to see if in that strange separation of what man is from what man does we may have some clues as to what the hell has gone wrong in this twentieth century.” Conversational in its account of the journey, focused and dense in its consideration of Greek thought, of classicism and Romanticism, of reason and feeling, Zen and the Art makes up in richness what it lacks in rigor. Pirsig’s questing reach exceeds his grasp in the same way our own awkward questions about life’s meaning outpace the capacity of our answers. His book is a renewing and exhilarating ride.",

An anthology of entertaining stories, her book is also an important intellectual document and a fierce argument for women’s education: “If it were customary to send little girls to school and teach them the same subjects as are taught to boys,” Pizan wrote at the turn of the fifteenth century, “they would learn just as fully and would understand the subtleties of all arts and sciences.”\n",

But Plato’s thought and—just as important—his elegant writing make nearly all of his twenty-odd dialogues rewarding reading. His work embodies the transition in human expression from the recited to the composed, and in human discourse from the oracular to the rational, getting thought, and all that thought might entail, onto a page where it could be assessed, reassembled, argued with, and then reconfigured into wisdom. His speculation in ideas is a kind of fiction in which the world is represented as a series of definitions; these definitions can then be constructed into conversations, and thereby into significance spun from reflection, communication, and the search for meaning.",

Plimpton had already survived several risky adventures in “participatory journalism,” including sparring with onetime light heavyweight boxing champ Archie Moore and playing quarterback in a preseason game for the Detroit Lions, an experience chronicled in the bestselling book, Paper Lion. This time, at least, he was less likely to get hurt. This book is too funny to be consigned to golfers alone. The game’s rich lore and the entertaining company of players and caddies on the course and in the clubhouse afford Plimpton splendid opportunities to demonstrate that, although he may have been a hopelessly inelegant golfer, he was nearly flawless as a sporting raconteur.\n",

A cultivated, compellingly readable companion, Pliny the Younger was best characterized by Frederic Raphael and Kenneth McLeish in a succinct note in their admirable volume, The List of Books: “Urbane; ironic; cool—a Renaissance humanist before his time.”",

The author’s pointed sense of drama and characterization made him a frequent source for Shakespeare, whose Julius Caesar, Coriolanus, and Antony and Cleopatra were all based upon these Lives. Montaigne, Rousseau, and Emerson—among countless other celebrated thinkers—often mined his abundant illustrative lessons as well. By his direct effect on readers and through the reach of those writers in his debt, Plutarch can fairly be called one of the most influential writers who ever lived.",

Collected Stories contains three complete volumes—Flowering Judas; Pale Horse, Pale Rider; The Leaning Tower and Other Stories—as well as four stories that had been previously unpublished in book form. The precision and assuredness of Porter’s prose and her uncanny knack for quickly probing the inner lives of her characters make every tale rewarding reading, but “Noon Wine” and the autobiographical Miranda cycle deserve special mention. The former, a short novel about a small-town murder, unfolds with the ineluctable logic of a Greek tragedy. The latter—beginning with the story “The Old Order” and continuing in “Old Mortality” before culminating in “Pale Horse, Pale Rider”—plumbs Porter’s memories of her childhood, her grandmother, and her own near-death experience in the influenza epidemic of 1918, revealing an extraordinary sensitivity to the experience of time in all its tenses. Both exhibit Porter’s art at its best, imbuing ordinary life with all the larger-than-life elements—love, death, eternity—that shadow it.",

        "text": "In the middle of World War II, a British scientist told American officials that he considered physicist Werner Heisenberg “the most dangerous possible German in the field because of his brain power.” Heisenberg had been awarded a Nobel Prize in 1932 for his work in theoretical physics and was widely respected among his colleagues. But, while his fellow physicists, many of them Jewish, fled the country for jobs in the United States and elsewhere, Heisenberg bought a house and told everyone who asked that he “loved his country, but not its regime,” and that his country needed him. In Heisenberg’s War, Thomas Powers, a Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter, makes the case that Heisenberg, who was appointed “chief theoretician” of Germany’s atomic bomb project in the first month of the war, purposely foiled the Germans’ atomic program. A suspenseful tale of science and espionage as well as military and moral drama, Powers’s book is an important piece of historical detective work, a riveting literary narrative, and a compelling portrait of a man who was one of the most brilliant and enigmatic figures of the twentieth century.

The Glastonbury of Powys’s novel is an immense canvas on which the figures and elements of a twentieth-century present—men, women, and children as well as animals and flowers, soil and stone and water—are haunted by the pentimento of storied centuries, from the ancient auras of King Arthur’s Avalon and the legend of the Holy Grail, which have long haunted the Somerset town, to the newer actualities of capitalism, communism, and tourism. Eternal impulses inform the public and private dramas that Powys depicts, giving his work a philosophical ambition and rhetorical scope that are breathtaking, bewildering, and pretty much beyond explication. Yet once you’ve entered the world of this novel, as George Steiner has put it, “almost everything else on your bookshelf will start looking thin.”\n",

Each piece has its own history, as well as an added significance supplied by its place in Praz’s memory, a value that is enhanced by the sophisticated style of the author’s reminiscence. We recognize at last in this house of life both the temper of genius and the soulfulness of taste, and see the apartment on the Via Giulia as what Praz himself, in writing this singular and original personal testament, proved it to be: “a mould of the spirit, the case without which the soul would feel like a snail without its shell.”\n",

        "text": "To give the barest outline, the narrative relates the arrival in Mexico in 1519 of a small band of Spanish soldiers under the command of Cortés. Aided by a native woman who became his interpreter and mistress, the invader was quick to recognize and exploit political dissension among the Aztecs. In a matter of weeks, he marched on the capital, Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City). Despite his modest force, Cortés quickly subjugated Montezuma’s powerful empire, in no small part because the Aztec chief believed the Spaniards to be supernatural beings, descendants of the god Quetzalcoatl. It is a story of fierce battles, bloody losses on both sides, and fateful reversals of fortune. Such a précis gives no adequate sense of the riveting strangeness of the incidents, characters, calamities, villainy, and heroism Prescott portrays. Based on prodigious research in Spanish archival documents and other primary sources, Prescott’s work is historically accurate in its large details (although his view of the Aztecs is subject in some degree to the assumptions of his nineteenth-century New England background and perspective). Yet, for the common reader, the admirable diligence of his scholarship is secondary to what Daniel J. Boorstin has termed his genius for the epic: “Though Prescott has been called the nation’s first ‘scientific historian’ for his use of manuscript sources,” the longtime Librarian of Congress wrote, “he would live on as a creator of literature.” Prescott’s History remains a stirring and compelling account of an extraordinary conquest.",

Like Dickens and Zola, Price is a storyteller whose eyes and ears naturally capture the fugitive emotions and details that can define characters and customs; he shares with them as well a novelistic intelligence that is magnanimous in the exact sense of the word.",

Imagine sitting on a shore, contemplating a vast and placid sea; imagine the waves slowly coming up to lift you off the sand and pull you gently toward the unfathomable deep, as a steady current lures you into regions of new sensation and meaning. That’s what reading Proust’s ocean of words is like, for those with the patience and daring to let themselves be carried away. In Search of Lost Time (known in earlier English translations as Remembrance of Things Past) comprises seven novels. I’ll let Proust’s own words serve as invitations to the next six.",

On a mission of mischievous espionage, they quickly discover more than they bargained for, stumbling on an assassination plot and eavesdropping on the explorer Lord Asriel’s description of his researches into magnificent celestial, scientific, and metaphysical mysteries in the Far North. The girl is twelve-year-old Lyra Belacqua, a supposed orphan, and the moth is, for the moment, the shape taken by her “dæmon,” Pantalaimon, in one of his myriad temporary incarnations. The most inspired creations in this transporting tale of a parallel universe resembling an enchanted version of our own, dæmons are manifestations of the inner life—embodiments of the soul—in animal form. Giving physical reality to ideas and states of mind through dæmons and other inventions, Pullman animates one of the most alluring imaginative worlds in modern literature. Combining enduring themes with headlong storytelling, The Golden Compass is sure to leave you wanting more, no matter your age. Happily, its sequels, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, which complete the trilogy called His Dark Materials, stand ready to supply it.",

In form, Onegin is a rarity—a novel written as a poem. It is divided into eight chapters, each of them containing several dozen stanzas. Devised by Pushkin, the “Onegin stanza” consists of fourteen lines, in iambic tetrameter, with the following rhyme scheme: ababccddeffegg. Remarkably, the effect of this formality is fleetness and brio: The verse’s rhythm makes the telling swift, and the ordering of incident and commentary into discrete stanzas brings a snapshot sequencing to the narration that is modern and seductive.",

Although her novels of unassuming gentlewomen, anthropologists, curates, and other members of the slightly distressed gentry have an immediate appeal by dint of their comedy, measured style, and sanity, it is Pym’s sympathy for both the goodness and the loneliness of her characters that has made readers welcome her as a kind of confidante. It’s comforting to know that someone as alert to human foibles as this author can recognize that the circumscribed experience of careful, patient people is as worthy of attention as the lives of adventurous or unscrupulous protagonists.",

(For what are paranoia and conspiracy but a desperate hope for an order that isn’t apparent on the surface of things?)",

        "text": "As the fundamental text of Islam, the Qur’an (or Koran) holds a revered place in the religious life of nearly two billion people around the globe. It also occupies a place in the ideological tumult of our age, where its messages are often distorted by fear, false assumptions, and misbegotten advocacy. It is a primary element of Islamic faith that the Qur’an in Arabic is the verbatim word of God, possessed of an authority no translation can convey. “We have made this (Qur’an) easy in your tongue,” God assures the Arabic-speaking faithful (in Ahmed Ali’s rendering). Its thousands of verses (ayat), arranged into 114 chapters (suras), constitute a body of wisdom, prescription, and exhortation that is meant to be prayed and pondered as much as read. In fact, the word “Qur’an” springs from the root meaning “to recite,” and the intricate rhyme and rhythmic energy that characterize the original Arabic—difficult if not impossible to mimic in English—are no doubt an aid to recitation of the verses.",

        "text": "Jonathan Raban was born in Norfolk, England. When he was seven years old, he read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and began daydreaming about floating down the mighty Mississippi. Thirty years later, in the fall of 1979, Raban’s childhood fantasy became a reality, though the craft in which he eventually set out wasn’t like Huck’s raft. Instead, it was a sixteen-foot aluminum motorboat that someone had christened Raban’s Nest. That painfully punning name may be the only bit of inelegant expression in this marvelous account of his river journey from Minneapolis to New Orleans. There is quiet comedy in Raban’s clear-eyed assessment of his ineptitudes and miscalculations, and a steady strain of satirical musing resonates from his close attention to the manners and foibles of the natives he encounters. His alertness is winning and invigorating, his prose an instrument of extraordinary perception. Here he is describing a row of businesses propping up the Memphis riverbank: “The bar/restaurants, dotting the ruined waterfront, were working hard to restore a touch of forced glitter to the . . . abandoned city. They had taken on a job that was out of all proportion to their powers.” Like the very best travel writers, Raban lives inside his language in a way that makes it a vehicle for the reader’s own reflective, ruminating inner life. In literary terms, he’s good company, and Old Glory will leave you wanting to ride his sentences on further journeys.",

In literary circles, the work generally has elicited smirks and howls, but it has spoken revelation, if not truth, to power and its brokers. The book’s pointed, merit-based reordering of conventional morality has inspired free-market champions and the technocratic elite, trickling down to straighten the intellectual posture of even ambitious politicians. Rand wrote it as a manifesto of her philosophy, which she called Objectivism and which, at its core, asserts that egoism is—and must be—the true measure of morality. Rand, a White Russian who emigrated from Saint Petersburg to New York in 1926, venerated the successful and spoke of the poor as “takers” and, more chillingly, “refuse.” When she died, a six-foot-tall floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was propped up next to her coffin, in—spoiler alert!—a poignant evocation of the last line of Atlas Shrugged.

        "text": "Winner of the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award in Poetry (in a sign of the book’s multivalent singularity, it was also a finalist in the Criticism category), Claudia Rankine’s remarkable book is about being a citizen in an uncivil union, a relationship that renders one’s figure in the world alternatively ominous and invisible. Something like a gallery, Citizen is unconventional in form as well as force: Photographic images and paintings are juxtaposed with text, and a section of the volume presents scripts for “situation videos.” Created with John Lucas, these are collage-like constructions of quotations and meditations on injustice, discrimination, and violence as reflected in specific instances, including Hurricane Katrina, the killings of Trayvon Martin and James Craig Anderson, the death of Mark Duggan at the hands of British authorities, and the policy of stop-and-frisk adopted by urban police forces. In the pages of Citizen, Rankine holds fast to what she’s seen, brings close what others have felt and suffered, and breathes language into the deadened air of grief, forcing herself—and her readers—to scrutinize the pain that racism provokes, and to stand still and ponder its cumulative injury and sorrow.

Adventure ensues when their friends' uncle's boat is burgled, but all comes right in the end, setting the stage for ten delightful sequels that similarly celebrate the resourcefulness of young people allowed to get their hands dirty as they master real skills—boating, camping, fishing, and the like—in a delightfully imagined but recognizable natural world.",

Saint was a teacher herself, and her working knowledge—and patience with learners young and old—pervades these thoughtful and generous accounts of the vibrant though unspectacular life of an English country schoolmistress and the denizens of Fairacre, her village. Everyday animation fills her pages, and there’s fine irony in the narrator’s gentle but perspicacious eye as it roams over a slow, small, well-measured life that, like high adventure, is no doubt best experienced in books.\n\n",

Shrewdly synthetic in its creative logic, Mumbo Jumbo is simultaneously fierce and funny, jubilant and angry. Exploding across its own pages like illicit fireworks, the book is a startling and colorful illumination of the tangled history of black-white relations.",

        "text": "Since Ruth Reichl would grow up to become a New York Times restaurant critic and the last editor of Gourmet magazine, we might assume she was nurtured in a family kitchen rich with culinary accomplishment. But nothing could be further from the truth. “I had three grandmothers and none of them could cook,” she writes. But if Reichl’s palate was acquired later rather than nurtured at home, her gifts as a storyteller were fostered from the start. “I learned early that the most important thing in life is a good story,” she says at the outset of Tender at the Bone, and she proceeds to serve up one after another. Rare among memoirists, Reichl paints her coming-of-age in its brightest, most forgiving colors; if she has chosen to idealize her education, it is not to escape it, but better to use it, both imaginatively and emotionally. Since that is the goal toward which all education strives—is, indeed, the true meaning of “growing up”—her book is as wise as it is nourishing, and heartwarming in every sense.",

But the reality of war in the trenches, as they witness unimagined carnage, leaves them struggling to keep their sanity and to survive. Published in Germany in 1929, All Quiet on the Western Front rapidly became an international bestseller. Remarque’s groundbreaking novel portrays the day-to-day horror and desperate futility of combat with searing and unprecedented force. Eschewing the idealized themes—nobility, nationalism, courage—that had been the conventional emphases of war literature, Remarque writes with relentless focus of the perils and privations of the soldiers’ lot. Most tellingly, by putting the narration in the all-too-human voice of nineteen-year-old Paul, the author gives his antiwar message a poignancy few writers have equaled; his voice provides a breathing presence that makes the constant senseless murder it describes all the more real, and all the more appalling.",

That tumultuous time culminated in the failed putsch of August 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev fell and Boris Yeltsin and the people of Moscow blocked the path of the conservative resurgence. Remnick’s gripping book bears unforgettable witness to that history, unrolling a canvas of collective memory that was hidden for decades behind the Kremlin’s curtain of forgetting. One might well call Lenin’s Tomb as compelling as a novel, but when history is as accomplished and astonishing as this, most fiction can’t hold a candle to it.",

Two weeks later, we’re told as the prologue concludes, Eunice was arrested for the murders because, we’re reminded, she could not read. “But there was more to it than that.” Narrating this tale of an evil housekeeper whose illiteracy spells inexorable doom for the happy family that employs her, Rendell creates an insidious atmosphere of terror, even though we know the outcome from the start. Her insight into the dilemmas of the isolated, afflicted, and socially at risk as well as her skill at probing the mentality of malefactors and their victims are on brilliant display.\n\n",

        "text": "In Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, the revelation of the existence of Bertha Mason, the first wife of Edward Rochester (the man Jane is about to marry), exposes Rochester’s duplicity, disrupting his bigamous wedding to Brontë’s heroine. The madwoman in the attic plays a larger role in the novel’s plot—but that’s another story. This story, Wide Sargasso Sea, imagines the early life of Brontë’s strange, benighted character, detailing her childhood and adolescence in the West Indies and tracing her tragic progress to her ultimate confinement in Rochester’s Thornfield Hall. Far from the monster Rochester loathes and Jane describes with fascinated horror, Rhys’s Bertha (known as Antoinette Crossway for most of Wide Sargasso Sea) is a sympathetic, tender, poignant figure. There but for the grace of God, the reader can’t help but think, goes Jane. If Jane Eyre is the most brooding and beautiful of romantic ballads, lushly orchestrated and achingly sung, Rhys’s compact and haunting tale is like a jazz improvisation on the same melody and themes: edgy, exploratory, startling, and unforgettable.",

Subverting convention in many ways, notably by making the vampire in question fallibly human and by presenting his story in his own words, Rice’s tale also embraces the genre’s Gothic-erotic roots with relish. The result is one of the best vampire novels ever written.",

More than most poetic voices, Rilke’s—so urgent, intimate, and eerily familiar—seems to intone prayers from that sacred place, enthralling us with a blend of delicacy and strength both seductive and encouraging. We suspect he speaks for us, even when the intuitions his words evoke are not wed to any clear logic. Rilke’s masterpieces are The Sonnets to Orpheus and The Duino Elegies, both published in 1923 (although the former was composed in less than a month, the latter was the product of a decade’s labor). Readers may find that lyrics in The Book of Hours (1905), The Book of Images (1902–06), and New Poems (1907–08) offer somewhat easier entry into his creative realm, but once you’ve wandered into it, you’ll want to linger.",

But Arthur Rimbaud, the wild and precocious genius of French verse, had already made his indelible mark: The eighty or so poems he wrote in his teenage years have given rise to more than a century’s worth of praise, criticism, interpretation, and hero worship. Indeed, the short fuse and bright explosion of Rimbaud’s gifts suggest descriptions that wouldn’t become current until the era of rock star troubadours that arrived a hundred years after his birth: punk, misfit, drugged-out hippie, gay hero, revolutionary, spoiled brat—the elements of his legend can make him seem all too familiar. And yet his influential poetry retains its strange and thrilling pull.",

Robb’s explication of the Andreotti affair is an exploration of a corruption so pervasive, so powerful, so fantastic, and so fatal that no novelist could have conceived it.",

In its ruminative examination of a family’s disappearing past and an old man’s diminishing future, Gilead unfolds with the inexorable, quiet majesty of daybreak, filled with the ever-present mysteries of light and grace and goodness.\n",

        "text": "Upon its initial publication in 1982, Hunger of Memory was read by many as a kind of policy statement about the schooling of minority students, bilingualism in the classroom, affirmative action, and related themes. Rodriguez traces the contours of his life with a set of seven essays—meditations, really—on  upbringing, language, achievement, faith, ethnicity, academia, and secrecy. The biographical narrative he threads through them is simple enough, circumscribed by home and school; his parents were working-class Mexican immigrants in Sacramento, California, and his elementary teachers were Irish nuns of the Sisters of Mercy. Yet, while Hunger of Memory treats all of the subjects suggested by the above, to read it as a book of advocacy, as the simple staking out of a set of positions, is to miss the drama of intimacy and eloquence at the core of this uneasy autobiography. The story of how education can estrange a student from his origins and complicate the ease with which he embraces familial affection is, of course, nothing new (the same sorrows, for instance, are enacted in the pages of Great Expectations). What’s special about Rodriguez’s version of the tale is its recognition that the language one’s education provides can be not just a mode of learning and expression, but a mode of worry as well, fretful and brooding and aware that it can never—despite a writer’s proficiency, even virtuosity—pin enough meaning to the page to make up for what’s been left unsaid.

        "text": "Elizabeth Romer’s Tuscan adventure began when she and her husband, John, a fellow archaeologist, were in search of a home somewhere between their native England and their digs in Egypt. Fortune brought them to a valley in Italy and the farm of the Cerotti family, who showed them a house they had for sale, made room for them at the lunch table, and invited them into what would become years of friendship. As the Romers soon learned, each of those years followed the same rhythm of agricultural and kitchen observance and activity. This book details the author’s education in the Tuscan annual round under the tutelage of materfamilias Silvana Cerroti. Romer is a wonderful writer, relaxed but unfailingly articulate in her vivid descriptions of the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes she encounters as she traverses the culinary calendar in Silvana’s footsteps, from the curing of prosciutto in the winter to cheese making in the spring and the gathering of wild mushrooms in the fall. Life takes solace in the rhythms of such rituals, as Romer discovers to her enduring satisfaction—and as the reader does, too, in her transporting book.",

Gripping and beautiful, Roosenburg’s memoir is a tale of bravery that will make you care deeply about its protagonists, even make you weep at their ordeal and homecoming.

        "text": "Adolf Hitler must be one of history’s most thoroughly examined figures. Historians, political scientists, psychoanalysts, philosophers, theologians, novelists, and, not least, victims have explored the facts of his life and the facets of his character, the fears he inflamed, the methods of murderous evil he invoked and embodied. And yet, as we learn in this riveting look at attempts to explain this demonic creature looming over twentieth-century history, Hitler still somehow escapes definition, even by those who have studied him most closely. Relying on formidable scholarly work and his dynamic reportorial skills, Ron Rosenbaum engages not only the explanations but the explainers in a series of fascinating, at times uneasy interviews. Through encounters with—among others—Daniel Goldhagen, the author of Hitler’s Willing Executioners; revisionist historian David Irving; George Steiner, the esteemed literary critic and author of the controversial novel The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.; and Claude Lanzmann, director of the landmark film Shoah, an oral history of the Holocaust, Rosenbaum interrogates the past and those who have devoted their lives to exploring its darkness. His restless curiosity and intellectual energy propel us through a dense forest of ideas, mysteries, and recognitions, forcing us to think about the nature and meaning of evil, about determinism and personal responsibility, about the capacities of human nature, and, most tellingly, about the limits of our “faith in an explicable world.”",

But what’s most memorable about this 1998 Pulitzer Prize winner is the way the author engages the subject of America with a fervor few novelists have dared since World War II. Passages of American Pastoral, especially those describing what was destroyed in the 1967 Newark riots, have a fierce and grieving majesty seldom matched in our literature. In telling the Swede’s story, albeit in the voice of Nathan Zuckerman, Philip Roth embraces his past with an almost penitential reverence, honoring the world that made him—and is now forever gone—with nostalgic, rueful, angry tenderness.",

Roth spent a half century turning sentences around themes of family and independence, ethnic identity and assimilation, artistic vocation and ordinary human pleasures, but he never turned them quite so gracefully as he does in The Ghost Writer.",

They are engrossing, instructive, accurate, and marvelous fun to read, and the present collection presents Roueché at his best.” Why not turn off the television and take a break from forensic dramas with some reality reading?

His meticulously detailed and unfailingly dramatic accounts are among the classics of true crime writing; mystery master Dorothy Sayers called Roughead “the best showman who ever stood before the door of the chamber of horrors.” Containing the author’s own choice of his best tales, Classic Crimes makes compelling reading. Throughout, it testifies to what Joyce Carol Oates has called Roughead’s “intelligence, skepticism, and flair for old-fashioned storytelling.” It’s a must for true crime aficionados.\n",

Through the vagaries of fame and exile, Rousseau’s sense of self seldom wavers, a fitting exhibition of his faith in an ineluctable identity that lies beneath the devitalizing accretions of social and cultural convention; indeed, it is his groundbreaking concept of selfhood that animated many of his most consequential philosophical, political, and educational theories and made him a prophet of the nineteenth-century Romantic movement in literature, art, and music. He embodied it with such fearless and unstinting energy that, even 250 years later, his Confessions is an absorbing and vibrant reading experience.\n",

They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.”\nSo, modestly, J. K. Rowling opens the saga that launched millions of readers around the world on a voyage across ten years and more than 4,000 pages, enthralled by the adventures of a boy named Harry Potter and the friends, mentors, and enemies he meets at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In their passage through Harry’s magical education, fans young and old have been held spellbound by Rowling’s compelling mix of boarding school camaraderie, delightfully arcane erudition as elaborated in the intricate traditions and curious curriculum of Hogwarts, recognizably adolescent instincts and uncertainties, heart-stopping exploits of derring-do, and, not least, the hopeful bravery of simple good versus complex evil. The progenitor of the most astonishing publishing phenomena in history, the first volume in the Harry Potter chronicle is happy evidence of the enduring magic and undiminished power of good storytelling—a magic and power that its sequels dispense with a more familiar but no less seductive lavishness.\n\n",

Their narrative charm has no better validation than the number of films based on them: to mention just a few, Lady for a Day (three versions); Little Miss Marker (four versions, beginning with the one that launched Shirley Temple’s stardom); The Lemon Drop Kid (two versions). Runyon’s world and characters were also the inspiration for one of the greatest American musicals, Frank Loesser’s Guys and Dolls. For all their cinematic and theatrical adaptation, the tales remain an undiluted pleasure when encountered on the page.\n",

        "text": "Imagine a literary love child of Charles Dickens and The Arabian Nights, and you’ll have some idea of the human interest and narrative ingenuity of Salman Rushdie’s masterpiece, one of the most admired, acclaimed, and enjoyed novels of the second half of the twentieth century. Like Dickens, Rushdie draws indelible characters and sets them in a swirling social context; he similarly shares a gift for exaggeration that gets closer to the truth about people than observational exactitude, illuminating his caricatures with a sense of justice and a sense of humor, often entwined. Like The Arabian Nights, Midnight’s Children leavens the world it depicts with magical capabilities and coincidences, thereby evoking the intense devotion our emotional lives demand of us, no matter our circumstances. Rushdie’s unshakable belief in the regenerative power of telling stories, a faith given form in the unrelenting narrative energy of Midnight’s Children, is a legacy of both forebears. The force of Rushdie’s prose is so propulsive, the currents of story-within-story so transporting, that each page is a further winding of the crank on an enormous jack-in-the-box that explodes again and again with the wonders of living that history can never contain.",

        "text": "John Ruskin’s passion, and his genius, found their most comprehensive and eloquent expression in The Stones of Venice, his monumental appraisal of Venetian architecture, ornament, and culture. In it Ruskin spends page after page praising the windows and columns of such Venetian monuments as the Doge’s Palace in Piazza San Marco, which he anoints as “the central building of the world.” Why? Because for Ruskin the Gothic expressed, as classical architecture did not, the talents and creativity of individual artisans, who combined thought and labor to thrilling effect. The subtext, at least for the nineteenth-century reader, was clear: In the midst of the Industrial Revolution, labor was increasingly alienated from the objects it produced; architecture, Ruskin implied, would suffer as a result. In recent decades, Ruskin has been discovered by a new generation, which sees in his engaged criticism—especially his concern for labor and the environment—a model for writing about art today. More broadly, no visitor to Venice, by airplane or armchair, will enjoy the trip as much without this brilliant, bracing companion.",

Less than fifteen years after the end of World War II, Cornelius Ryan constructed a fleet and intricate narrative of the maneuverings on both sides of the English Channel during the ambitious operation that would turn the tide of the battle against Hitler and the Third Reich. As he writes in his foreword, The Longest Day is “not a military history. It is the story of people: the men of the Allied forces, the enemy they fought and the civilians who were caught up in the bloody confusion of D-Day.” Ryan’s swift, compelling chronicle weaves the stories of individuals into a tough fabric of suspense and history, honoring the private dimensions—the courage, fear, fortune, and faith—that shaped the fateful day. It is difficult to put this book down and impossible not to be awed by the scope of the events described. ",

Eliot, and it is Witold Rybczynski’s intention in this enlightening book to explain how very long it took us to arrive at that starting point. Privacy, domesticity, comfort, the concept of home and family we have inherited—these were all quite clearly invented in the course of the past five hundred years. What makes Home so engaging is the variety of thought it provokes. By making us see that the most familiar elements of our lives were once unfamiliar—were, indeed, once nonexistent—Rybczynski leads us to speculate on things we normally barely notice. An architect and professor of architecture and urbanism, Rybczynski is a winsome writer, clearheaded and without an ideological ax to grind—although he is very sharp on the naïveté of architectural modernism in the domestic realm.",

Taking hold of your wife’s head as if it were the very thing you were searching for, you try to pick it up and put it on. This last scenario, which describes the very real affliction of a very real musician, provides this surprising book—a phenomenal bestseller upon its publication in 1985—with its title essay. Dr. Oliver Sacks, a clinical neurologist, collected two dozen such tales in this volume, each a compelling examination of a neurological disorder. The case histories, written in clear, sure prose, introduce us to people whose unusual ailments make up a gallery of curious experience, including twins who communicate with each other by exchanging twelve-digit prime numbers, a man who dreams that he’s a dog and wakes with a canine’s sensitivity to smell, and an autistic eight year old who is completely uncommunicative except for an uncanny talent for drawing. One cannot read these tales without feeling a mixed sense of terror and wonder before the human brain’s unfathomable complexity and delicate balance. Dr. Sacks provokes deep reflection on how our minds work, and on the sobering fact that they might not always work the way we take for granted they will.",

Employing his celebrated gift for lucid explication of complex scientific matters, he produces a breathtaking overview of the nature and development of human intelligence. In the more than four decades since the publication of The Dragons of Eden, some of Sagan’s theorizing has surely been overtaken by new research. But the bold sweep of the book’s perception still opens unforgettable vistas of knowledge and imagination.",

While the rest of medieval literature was locked in lines of verse, the unknown authors of the sagas freely employed prose to fashion fictions of mythic roots and visionary scope that nonetheless portrayed, in realistic detail, the lives of the Norse families who first settled Iceland. Long before the advent of the novel as a robust form, these tales of independent men and women—farmers, poets, warriors, adventurers, outlaws, and matriarchs—expanded the domain of storytelling in tales that remain both puzzling and compelling today. Encompassing history and myth, the epic and the tragic, the comic and the sublime, these tales re-create a world of honor codes, feuds, and abiding obsessions in which the demands of agricultural work are treated with the same respect as heroic motives and burdens.",

By far the most famous of his literary works is a children’s book, The Little Prince, illustrated with Saint-Exupéry’s own drawings. Published a year before its author’s death, this endearing philosophical fable became one of the most beloved books of the twentieth century.",

Salinger’s Holden Caulfield is the embodiment of everything it is to be sixteen, smart, directionless, skeptical, and on the brink of adult life in mass market America. In creating a voice for his protagonist, Salinger reached back to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn for a mode of address refreshing in its directness; to this he added a modern, sarcastic knowingness that was shocking in its day and even now remains conspiratorially engaging.\n",

It is this other which causes the trouble, this other we long to see.” Stunning in the exact sense, Light Years will leave you newly alert to the lives and loves within your grasp, and the ones that lie just beyond it.",

You want to keep going, and when you do, you’ll likely find yourself halfway through this memoir of coming-of-age in Ridgefield, Connecticut, before you look up. From an early age, Salzman was unconventional, supplying his older self with terrific material. His fascination with Chinese boxing and philosophy, for instance, leads him into all sorts of attempts at discipline and solemnity, such as wearing a bald wig in lieu of shaving off his hair, walking to school barefoot in the snow, and taking kung fu lessons from a sadist. Yet the very familiarity of the appointments of his suburban childhood and adolescence, and his more-or-less standard stumble toward adulthood, are what make this memoir so telling, and so funny.",

We know little about the poet’s life: She was born on the island of Lesbos in the latter part of the seventh century BC, and her poetic gifts were praised by Plato and honored throughout antiquity. In fact, much of the work that has come down to us (in essence, one complete poem and two-hundred-odd fragments) has survived as quotations in the works of other authors. As Homer gave verse its bone, strength, and sinew, Sappho blessed it with flesh and bright senses, suppleness and grace. Even the bits and pieces that are her legacy are imbued with intimacy, marked by the touch and scent of pleasure and desire. ",

It distills and presents the ideas that Sartre explored at great length in his magnum opus, Being and Nothingness, published a year earlier. In the play, three sinners, shown into a grand drawing room done up in the style of Napoleon III’s Second Empire, pose for and provoke one another, powerless to escape the others’ gaze. As it becomes clearer that they’re stuck together for eternity, Garcin, Inès, and Estelle find themselves on a not-so-merry-go-round of accusations, cruelties, confessions, doubts, and humiliations. Each serves as both torturer and victim, unable to evade self-knowledge and its reflection in, and judgment by, the other two. Reduced to their dependence upon one another, they see no redemption in sight. As Garcin puts it in the play’s most famous line, “Hell is—other people!” And a clever, gripping, living hell it is. ",

Sherston is merely the name Sassoon adopts for himself as he narrates his story. Sassoon tells his story in three volumes: childhood and the prewar years; combat and protest; hospitalization and post-protest experiences up to age thirty-two. Taken together, The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston is generally held to be, along with Good-bye to All That by Sassoon’s friend and fellow soldier-poet Robert Graves, the finest autobiographical work to have come out of Britain about World War I. Sassoon’s writing differs from Graves’s most notably in seeming to be the product of a fragile, war-damaged psyche: His narrative—eloquent, powerful, and unfailingly compelling—is eerie, fevered, told by someone who has looked too long into the mouth of hell.",

Her flat and deceptively simple art parses her experience panel by panel with enriching perspectives; her visual compositions are as adept at representing millennia of despotic history in a single frame as they are at illustrating her flirtation with conformity and rebellion in the face of political upheaval, fundamentalist oppression, and shatteringly violent war with Iraq.",

The large pages, with illustrations integrated into the text, are seductive. You can open the book anywhere and, lured by a sentence or one of the brilliantly chosen reproductions of paintings, woodcuts, and etchings, happily fall into it for a few moments, or for hours at a time.",

        "text": "“When a man dies,” writes Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in Wind, Sand, and Stars, “an unknown world passes away.” The hard bone of each skull, he continues, “is in a sense an old treasure chest”: “what colored stuffs, what images of festivities, what vestiges” it might contain! The treasure a man carries inside him, even if he has carefully exposed it in his own writing, can be buried by a biographer intent on piling facts into a scholarly monument. Fortunately for readers, Stacy Schiff undertakes her 1994 life of the French aviator and author with a true appreciation of the imaginative riches her subject possessed, and the result is a riveting and illuminating life of one of the most romantic figures of the twentieth century. Schiff’s generous understating of the courage, confusion, and creativity that marked Saint-Exupéry’s life, from boyhood through his formative, exotic adventures in open cockpits, from his public dignified idealism to his private bewildered despair, makes her prose resonate with his own themes. The stylish composition of her narrative conveys the substance of her subject’s imagination nearly as well—if not as lyrically and meditatively—as his works do, and her writing amplifies his exploration of the danger, isolation, and grandeur of flight with moving proof of the danger, isolation, and grandeur of a single remarkable life.",

        "text": "According to Jewish tradition, the equilibrium of the world rests upon thirty-six Just Men, the Lamed-Vov, who are born in every age to bear the weight of human grief. “[I]f just one of them were lacking, the sufferings of mankind would poison even the souls of the newborn, and humanity would suffocate with a single cry,” writes André Schwarz-Bart in the opening chapter of The Last of the Just. The novel reaches back to this ancient legend through the lineage of Ernie Levy, whose family has known the grace of one Lamed-Vovnik in each generation for three-quarters of a millennium. Schwarz-Bart was born in France to Polish Jews who were deported to Auschwitz in 1941. By the age of fifteen, he was fighting in the French Resistance. Drawing on his personal experience and the wider tragedy of the Holocaust, as well as the longer history of Jewish persecution, he fashioned a novel filled with vibrant characters and keen human sympathy. His detached realism is colored with moments of religious, at times almost magical, epiphany that deepen the indelible power and nobility of his tale.",

What ties the disparate components of Sebald’s art and the separate stories of The Emigrants together is the way that history and tragedy exert a tidal pull on sentences that recount the unremarkable surfaces of ordinary lives. The intimate force of his work has often been called uncanny, and that it is; it’s unforgettable, too.\n",

        "text": "The Golden Gate is a novel about a group of worthy but unexceptional Bay Area people falling in and out of love on the path to middle age. There are also serious forays, via rumination, conversation, and incident, into matters of the heart, celibacy and sexual identity, music and politics, families and friendships—even, from time to time, into the narrator’s concern about the manner in which he’s relating his tale: in fourteen-line tetrameter stanzas (690 of them!), rhymed ababccddeffegg to match the form of the novel’s inspiration, Charles Johnston’s translation of Alexander Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin. You’d think the verse’s intricate form would hinder Seth’s storytelling, but you’d be wrong; his rhymes lead us so fleetly through the action that it is hard to put the book down (even the table of contents, summarizing the action of each chapter without breaking the Onegin stanza mold, is replete with interest and invention). Amusing, clever, and artfully true to life, it’s one of the most enticing novels you’ll ever pick up.",

Working from the combatants’ own letters and other primary documents, Shaara has fashioned characters who live upon the page in a way that conveys the human drama of the epic battle that left fifty thousand soldiers dead, wounded, or missing. The fears and hopes, memories and actions, of the protagonists in the face of Gettysburg’s unrelenting carnage makes The Killer Angels one of the most deeply moving war novels ever written.",

Animated with what seems an endless supply of indelible phrases—from “brevity is the soul of wit” and “to the manner born” to “the lady doth protest too much” and “to thine own self be true”—its more than four thousand lines plumb a bottomless well of human quandaries. Generations of actors, audiences, scholars, readers, critics, psychologists, and philosophers have attempted to fathom the meaning of the work and the motivations of its hero, yet both elude easy definition. So lively is the play’s language, so vital its characters, so cunning its drama, and so enigmatic its central figure that both play and protagonist increase in stature every time they escape our ready understanding. One of the pinnacles of literary art, Hamlet is inexhaustible.",

Indeed, legend—albeit largely unsupported by textual evidence—has it that even Elizabeth the queen was smitten by the character: Her call for a play on the theme of Falstaff in love allegedly prompted the Bard to compose The Merry Wives of Windsor. Henry IV, Part 2 picks up where Part 1 leaves off, but its tone is darker, for the play is dominated by the king’s battles with illness and relentless political unrest. The crown Henry has usurped never sits easily on his brow: His struggle with rebellious nobles is mirrored by the turmoil of his own soul as he broods upon the consequences of his revolt against Richard II. Nevertheless, Falstaff again steals most of the show with his scheming antics; his seductive cleverness nearly scatters the dark shadows cast by the monarch’s concerns of state and conscience.",

        "text": "If the opening drama of the Henriad locates its emotional center in the quiet monologues of Richard II, the closing play finds its motive force in the stirring rhetoric Henry V declaims to rally his troops as they prepare to battle the French at Agincourt. Throughout, the patriotic pulse of Henry V is quickened by a military drumbeat. Inspiring his far-outnumbered troops to an astonishing victory, the once unworthy son of Henry IV—now a heroic amalgam of bravery, brutality, piety, and ruthlessness—unites his kingdom in nationalistic fervor. Historically, Henry V’s achievements may be open to question; dramatically, his exploits are entirely satisfying, and conclude Shakespeare’s Henriad with a rousing flourish.",

Although the setting and action (political assassination and its aftermath) make it different in kind from Romeo and Juliet, both share a clean narrative line in which the climactic elements of the tale are foretold. Shakespeare follows the historical record fairly closely in depicting both the murder of Julius Caesar at the hands of Brutus, Cassius, and their fellow republicans and the subsequent turning of the tables on the perpetrators by Mark Antony and Octavius. The protagonists are richly drawn, and several vie for our attention; through their variety and complexity, the dramatist reveals how history is molded not just by the actions of men, but by their characters as well.",

Wandering between the domains of the daughters he has favored, Lear is soon denied his fatherly prerogatives and his regal retinue, then locked out of the shelter of their castles. Wandering a barren heath, he rages across the boundaries between order and wildness, sanity and madness. Reduced to a voice in the wilderness, he calls the powers of wind and rain down upon his naked being, having been stripped, through his own agency, of the fragile clothing—literal and figurative—that protects human nature from nature’s awful, reckless truths.",

His bloody progress is prepared and abetted by the machinations of his wife, who curdles her husband’s nature—“too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness,” she claims—into a poisonous brew.

The actors’ presences make the antics easier to follow, and good timing points up the humor of the rapid-fire wordplay, which may seem arcane in its intricate foolishness but bears a striking resemblance to the familiar pleasures of Abbott and Costello’s “Who’s on first?” routine, or some of the pun-driven volleys of the Marx Brothers’ repartee. Yet one comedy, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, is so replete with intoxicating poetry that no reader should miss it. Transformations wrought by longing and magic under the influence of the midsummer moon are emblems of the capricious emotions that inspirit our lives and that, for all their lack of substance, embolden our actions and form our destinies, sometimes even conjuring from mere fancy “something of great constancy.” A Midsummer Night’s Dream may well be the happiest tribute in all literature to the way love’s fleeting promise not only haunts our dreams, but lingers to inhabit our hearts in the light of common day.",

        "text": "Despite being an outsider, Othello is honored as the defender of Venice, and he falls ardently in love with Desdemona, a patrician daughter of the city, who has been swept away by the romantic aura of exotic adventure the noble Moor exudes. Although many of its scenes take place out of doors, the drama presents itself in psychologically claustrophobic close-up, our attention always zooming in to focus on Othello’s villainous ensign, Iago, who manufactures a series of incidents to discredit Desdemona and to corrupt his commander’s adoration of her. Othello’s sure-footed decisiveness, a boon in battle (and, in a way, the very opposite of Hamlet’s profound hesitation), leaves him awkward and uncertain in the sphere of private emotions. Iago preys upon this weakness, wielding words with lethal precision to transform his own envy into Othello’s jealousy. Relentlessly malign, Iago is a portrait of evil as sharply etched as any in literature. His insidious malevolence constricts the play’s tragic ambitions to the mean dimensions of his own twisted heart, making Othello a work of intensely concentrated, breathtaking power.",

Music amply rewards any reader’s attention, yet there is more to The Sonnets than a considerable catalog of lovely and quotable lines. Much has been made of the mysterious muses who incite the poet’s fancy: The first 126 poems are addressed to a young man, and sonnets 127 to 152 address a woman who has become known as “the dark lady” (the last two sonnets draw portraits of Cupid). And yet, despite the fact that Shakespeare exploits every trope of amorous verse, the real extended subject of these rhymes is the triumph of verse over the vagaries of time.\n",

In short, he is funny as hell, and more resoundingly eloquent than a chorus of angels in heaven.

        "text": "In Greek mythology, Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with a woman he had carved in stone. Taking pity on the lovesick artist, the gods brought the statue to life: Creator and creation married and had a child. That’s the legend that provides the title for George Bernard Shaw’s play. Shaw’s central character is not a sculptor, but a professor of phonetics by the name of Henry Higgins. He boasts that merely by changing the accent of Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl, he can pass her off in polite society as a refined lady. Shaw’s prefaces to his plays always make provocative and rewarding reading, and in the substantial one that precedes Pygmalion he asserts that “it is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him. . . . The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic enthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular play.” And popular Pygmalion has certainly been. Not only is it the prolific author’s best-loved work, but it also inspired one of Broadway’s greatest triumphs, the 1956 Lerner and Loewe musical My Fair Lady.",

In the early 1930s he went to India, to cover the emergence and growing influence of an apostle of nonviolence, Mahatma Gandhi, and then to Paris, as European correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune; in 1935 he moved to Berlin, to report firsthand on the horrific events set in motion by a murderous avatar of evil, Adolf Hitler.\n",

Yet the lasting appeal of the Pillow Book reaches beyond its historical importance, and modern readers will be rewarded—“entranced” may be a better word—by the book’s revelation of its author’s personality. Sei Shōnagon’s brilliant prose style is matched by her considerable poetic gifts, and both are complemented by her penchant for gossip and acerbic remarks. Across the gulf of more than a millennium, her wit and intelligence remain seductive, and her eloquence holds the reader rapt.",

He saw how the peasantry—already imprisoned, in Silone’s words, by “the everlasting poverty handed down by fathers who inherited it from grandfathers, in the face of which honest toil had never been any use”—was taken advantage of by those in power. What sets Silone’s political novel apart from others of its kind, and what makes it one of the most moving novels of the twentieth century, is his tender embrace of the human condition in all its poignant contradictions. His peasants are people, not avatars or messengers; they’re flawed and funny and no purer than others, and his activists and priests are similarly perplexing—and perplexed. Their very humanity, like bread and wine, is the fruit of the harsh and unpredictable earth.\n",

        "text": "In this novel, the Dogs who do the telling ages and ages into the future are the inheritors of human sentience and sensibility, continuing to live fully without any irritable grasping after certainty, content with whatever miracles the universe will provide. The legends they relate around their fires rehearse the legacy of Man, a creature become myth, whose spiritual—there is no other word quite as apt—memory the canines sustain in their simple and desolate serenity. Author Clifford Simak offers a wry perspective on the whole history of urban dissolution that City narrates, a process that ends not in apocalyptic drama but in an eerie, universal loneliness. A melancholy paean to mutability and longing, Simak’s novel is elegiac and intoxicating. If the Ovid of the Metamorphoses had written twentieth-century speculative fiction, it might well read something like City.",

        "text": "French novelist Georges Simenon wrote hundreds of works of fiction, yet his most enduring creation remains the detective Jules Maigret. One of the most popular detectives in the annals of the mystery genre, Simenon’s Parisian police inspector wends his way through the plots of seventy-five novels and a third as many stories, smoking his pipe, stopping here and there for a fortifying drink, enjoying the simple pleasure of a good meal, and untangling complex knots of murder and passion through the application of observation and intuition. The murder victim in Maigret and the Man on the Bench is a quiet soul who breaks the predictable pattern of his days—and the grip of his domineering wife—to create a secret existence within the confines of his daily commute. By a canny focus on a puzzling pair of shoes, Maigret deciphers the mystery of Louis Thouret’s life and death, with all kinds of insights and surprises and plenty of Parisian characters and atmosphere along the way. You’ll be sorry when you turn the last page, but happy that there are seventy-four more Maigret tales to enjoy.",

A prolific writer who published dozens of novels, memoirs, and children’s books, Singer is best known for his short stories. Although his tales reached their widest readership in their English versions, Singer wrote in Yiddish—“the tongue of martyrs and saints,” as he once called it, “rich in humor and in memories that mankind may never forget. In a figurative way, Yiddish is the wise and humble language of us all, the idiom of frightened and hopeful humanity.” That idiom permeates Singer’s stories, for whatever their setting, time period, or cast of characters, these deceptively simple narratives are steeped in the author’s distinctive brew of faith, fable, and desire.\n",

He makes his way to his old home, but the house is dark, the door secured with three rusty padlocks. A black cat appears to lead him through silent streets in search of the keys that will unlock the gate to his lost\nchildhood. Sís’s images, crowded with detail and decoration, create an exhilarating cityscape that spreads like a map over the large pages. They are washed with colors both muted and luscious, colors that coat the illustrations with the mystic, tentative, tantalizing affections of remembrance. One falls into his marvelous memory palace like a thought tumbling into sleep—and dreams. Disguised as a children’s book in format and style, The Three Golden Keys will nourish the imagination of any reader. It is a gift, humble and noble, and a loving legacy, which illustrates that the child is not only father to the man, but muse as well.",

Her cells, obtained without her permission or knowledge during treatment for terminal cancer in 1951, were the first human cells to be replicated and kept alive under controlled conditions in a laboratory. The cell line her tissue culture spawned enabled numerous breakthroughs, including the development of the polio vaccine, cloning techniques, chemotherapy drugs, AIDS medications, in vitro fertilization, and gene mapping, as well as tests for sensitivities to many medicines and products. Told with a narrative fluency equal to the technical and emotional challenges of her subject—including profound ethical questions of patient consent and family privacy— Skloot’s book is animated by voices that reveal, again and again, the shifting perspectives that make the story of Henrietta Lacks so compelling.\n",

Over the next three years, he piloted boat on a historic voyage across 46,000 miles. Sailing Alone Around the World tells the entire tale. Whether navigating storms and coral reefs, eating flying fish for breakfast, disguising his solitude at the approach of pirates, or calling at far-flung ports (once to meet the explorer Henry Stanley, and once to be mistaken for the Antichrist by zealous Christian converts), Slocum is delightful company. In a direct and unpolished voice, he relates his adventures—and his often valiant exertions—with a sly humor and flinty intelligence that make this classic a spirited journey indeed.",

Yet her tone is so inviting and the connections she draws between disparate works are so natural that we are inspired rather than put off by her learning. Although this is not an easy book to read, it is an encouraging one, composed with such playfulness and ingenuity that we feel capable of approaching Smith’s themes with something like her own alertness.",

It is easy to understand readers’ identification with Francie’s experience, even if their own lives have no ostensible common ground with that of the young girl collecting rags and copper, buying penny candy, stretching toward adulthood from the shadow of urban poverty. For the alleys and avenues that the story leads us down are not specific to Smith’s Brooklyn; they are the streets of childhood, the sidewalks of loneliness and yearning, the passageways of sentiment that carry us toward and away from home and family. They make up the neighborhood where the imagination grows up, and Smith’s poignant book delivers it whole, whatever the details of time and place.",

It is the voice of the narrator, so unusual, alive, and imaginative, that makes the book so captivating. Cassandra’s struggle to put her experience into words, to capture her feelings in sentences that reflect their depth, their strength, and their resourcefulness, is exhilarating to share.",

        "text": "Martin Cruz Smith’s Gorky Park was a blockbuster when it appeared in 1981. It introduced readers to Arkady Renko, a Moscow homicide investigator caught in the twin grip of Russian soulfulness and Soviet bureaucracy. Renko is a compelling character: smart, tough, reflective, inured to the futility of his own sensitivity, yet sensitive nonetheless. He is a man of wit and learning condemned to the harsh realities of tawdry crime and state-sponsored spiritual disillusionment—which makes him, from a reader’s point of view, very good company. The action of this second Renko novel is largely confined to a commercial fishing trawler in the icy Bering Sea. There, in the wake of his Gorky Park exploits, the officially disgraced Renko works the “slime line”—gutting fish by the thousands—in hopes that the job’s anonymity and remoteness from Moscow will protect him from those seeking to either harm or, perhaps more frighteningly, “rehabilitate” him.",

Two young and glamorous sybaritic socialites, George and Marion Kerby, perish in a drunken accident. Finding themselves celestially repurposed as ghosts, they whimsically attach themselves to a milquetoast businessman with the improbable name of Cosmo Topper. They beguile him to act less stuffy and to enjoy himself, with Marion an untouchable succubus, tempting Topper with ineffable delights that never quite materialize. Eventually Topper gives in and lets go, and bluenoses and minor tyrants of all stripes receive an ebullient rebuke in this forerunner to all classic screwball comedies.",

        "text": "One of the founding spirits of the English novel, Tobias Smollett was a man of many parts: novelist, physician, historian, poet and dramatist, translator (his rendering of Don Quixote is still in circulation today), editor and critic, medical writer, pioneering travel writer. Yet his primary place in literary history—as a writer of episodic humor populated with memorable characters—comes from having imported into English the energies of French and Spanish picaresque fiction. The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, published in the year of his death (1771), is his best novel. Humphry Clinker offers readers a vibrant depiction of eighteenth-century Britain, from the fashionable attractions of Bath to the filthy sprawl of London, from the newly popular pastime of beach-going to the disgusting food, foul water, and revolting accommodations that were the traveler’s lot in the 1760s. Smollett’s satirical bent is balanced by his sensitivity to the poverty and social injustice his characters witness. In this, as in his gift for creating unforgettable comic characters, he was both a precursor and an inspiration to Charles Dickens.",

The souls of these two thousand lost sailors, as Dava Sobel elegantly puts it, precipitated (with all the speed a government can muster) the famed Longitude Act of 1714, in which Parliament promised a prize of £20,000 (well over ten million dollars in today’s currency) for a comprehensive solution to the longitude problem, which, simply put, was this: How do you know where you are once you’ve lost sight of land? Sobel’s narrative of John Harrison’s forty years of struggle to improve his invention (the chronometer) and to claim the prize, which George III finally awarded him in 1773, is a fine and fascinating journey.",

        "text": "In 1872, Leland Stanford, transportation magnate and mastermind of the recently completed transcontinental railroad (and benefactor of the university that bears his name), hired Eadweard Muybridge to photograph Occident, one of the fastest horses in the country, to settle a debate about whether a trotting horse’s four hooves are ever off the ground at the same time. With both imaginative and technological ingenuity, Muybridge answered Stanford’s question by capturing multiple images of the horse as it was running. Muybridge went on to do the same with other animals and with people. Muybridge’s innovations (and Stanford’s, too, in bridging a continent with mechanical speed) would forever alter our experience of time and place, paving the way for both Hollywood and Silicon Valley. It’s hard to imagine a more insightful guide to the “technological Wild West” that has shaped American modernity than Rebecca Solnit, whom critic Lawrence Weschler describes as “one of the most agile, protean, and consistently (jaw-droppingly) fascinating writers” at work today. She does a typically brilliant job here, weaving biography, history, landscape, and critical insight into a rare and provocative read.",

        "text": "Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s detailed indictment of the state is drawn from his own bitter experience as well as from the reports, memoirs, and letters of 227 fellow zeks. With relentless realism and psychological acuity, he follows the course of arrest, interrogation, imprisonment, and oppression as suffered by millions upon millions of Soviet citizens. To unearth the roots of this endemic brutality and show how it grew from revolutionary seeds planted by Lenin (Solzhenitsyn repudiates any explanation of the Gulag as cultivated by Stalin alone), he uses reminiscence as well as sociological analysis, individual histories and documentary detail as well as political insight. The book’s compassion is strengthened by the unblinking determination of its testimony, irrefutable in its abundance and its human density; and yet, as in One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, Solzhenitsyn colors his narrative with threads of humor, deepening its hold on our hearts and minds. Written from 1958 to 1968, The Gulag Archipelago was published in English in three volumes, 1974–79. An authorized single-volume abridgement appeared in English in 1985.",

The relentless brutality of Stalinist oppression is rendered all the more powerful by the author’s focus—alternately fierce and tender—on the mundane dimensions of Ivan’s experience. In simple and recognizable sensory detail, Solzhenitsyn portrays the hunger Ivan and his comrades feel, the cold they suffer, the bodily fatigue and degradations that are their lot.",

Many modern readings of the tale (including mid-twentieth-century restagings by Jean Anouilh and Bertolt Brecht) do so. Yet such an interpretation does not do justice to the complexity of Sophocles’s drama, in which the importance of public allegiance over private fealty is strongly argued. Nevertheless, Antigone’s bravery and the terrifying severity of her conviction make her tower over the calculating Creon, who at last yields to her resolve, too late to prevent calamity for all concerned. In this, as in all of Sophocles’s plays, virtue is as uncertain as circumstance, and no moral impulse is pure; the essence of his tragic figures is their human presence in the midst of incompatible and often overwhelming truths.",

As readers make their way slowly through the opening pages, the setting may seem strange, the customs curious, the ubiquitous presence of the ancestral spirits disconcerting. Caught in the complex contradictions of British colonialism, Aké is also a place animated by the spirits of its native Yoruba folklore and religion. Despite what for many readers may be an unfamiliar setting, Soyinka’s luminous memoir of his first eleven years is characterized by an uncanny fidelity to the sensations, uncertainties, and confidences of childhood—the continent on which inhabitants dwell in a landscape composed in equal parts of reality, faith, superstition, and personality. The first black African to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, Soyinka has met with acclaim as a playwright, novelist, poet, and critic. Aké stands on its own as his most magical book.",

        "text": "Freya Stark, who died in 1993 having lived a hundred years, journeyed where few European men had dared to go—through North Africa, the Levant, Turkey, Persia, Syria, Anatolia, and Kurdistan. She exemplified the bravery, stubbornness, and literary sensibility that characterized the intrepid English traveler. She dismayed friends and family by setting out in 1927 on the trip that was to become the basis for The Valleys of the Assassins. In addition to wanting to see an uncharted valley on the border of Iraq and Iran, she was in search of the legendary lost fortress of the Lords of Alamut, a band of hashish-fueled assassins that Marco Polo had described in his own Travels. Stark had not intended to write a book about her exploits, but upon her return, her mother typed up the diaries she had kept and\ninsisted she rewrite them for publication. Displaying her wise purchase on place, history, and people, The Valley of the Assassins is permeated with Stark’s authorial genius—aphoristic, vigilant, exquisitely well mannered—that would articulate the heart and mind of the traveler in many subsequent books.",

Japanese Inn is all told a marvelous collection of vignettes steeped in the color and character of Japanese tradition; it delivers the kind of pleasure Statler himself must have found so restorative at the Minaguchi-ya.",

Ferdinando Galiani (1728–1787) was a Neapolitan priest-diplomat and economist. A Man, a Woman, and Two\nKingdoms chronicles their friendship, allowing us to delight in the sparkling correspondence they began when Galiani was recalled from Paris to Naples in reprimand for diplomatic indiscretion. In their letters, mutual friends—including Diderot, Voltaire, Rousseau, and the fascinating Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm—come to life as representatives of the ideas current in that intellectually electric age. Fashioning a narrative that is stimulating, amusing, even riveting, Steegmuller makes us feel the truth of Talleyrand’s assertion—invoked at the outset of this book—that anyone who had not lived in pre-Revolutionary France could not fully know life’s pleasure. Celebrated as a biographer (his Cocteau won a National Book Award in 1971), translator (his version of Flaubert’s Madame Bovary set the standard for decades), scholar, and versatile man of letters (he even penned a marvelous mystery, The Blue Harpsichord), Francis Steegmuller here combines his talents and erudition into a sophisticated entertainment of the highest order—a moving tale of human intimacy that is also a grand tour of history and ideas.",

Best of the best is the 1971 novel Angle of Repose. A human drama in which two stories span four generations, and in which then and now are inextricably bound, Angle of Repose is at once a family saga, a Western quest, and a meditation on history. It is a book which, in the author’s words, “reveals how even the most rebellious crusades of our time follow paths that our great-grandfathers’ feet beat dusty.” Stegner tells us that the past, like a vast landscape, must be settled into if it is to inform and enrich our lives.",

Toklas was written entirely by Gertrude Stein (“as Defoe did the autobiography of Robinson Crusoe,” she explains toward the end) in an extended act of literary impersonation. While playfully pretending to be her partner, Stein writes chiefly about her own life in Paris in the company of her celebrated friends, composing as she goes a gossipy (albeit highly selective and incomplete) account of the literary and artistic personalities who made Paris the capital of modernism in the 1910s and 1920s. Spiced with anecdotes (including a few sharp enough to have earned the lasting displeasure of Matisse and Hemingway), Stein’s reflections on her own life through the eyes of her confidante are a sparkling, amusing treat.

        "text": "Published in March 1939, Steinbeck’s saga of the havoc wreaked by the Great Depression was soon the country’s number one bestseller, selling thousands of copies each week despite the difficult economic times. At the same time, communities from coast to coast found it obscene and banned (and even burned) it. The author’s portrait of the poverty suffered by members of the Joad family, the Oklahoma sharecroppers the novel follows from the Dust Bowl to California’s Salinas Valley, made the book politically suspect as well—its obvious sympathy for the victims of economic devastation called into question the virtues and verities of American capitalism. The Joads are a hard, funny, tenacious, colorful bunch, but the road they travel is strewn with death, hunger, social unrest, violence, and misfortune of every stripe. Still, the family endures, with a dignity distilled from survival, stripped of all material comfort or social adornment. Modern literature had no champion of that dignity more steadfast than John Steinbeck, and The Grapes of Wrath is his masterpiece.\n",

Travels with Charley is his account of the trip, which took him from New York to Maine to the Pacific Northwest, down the coast to his hometown of Salinas, California, then back east along the southern route. There is much nostalgia in these pages for a time when life was decidedly local and place was as powerful a determinant of character as mass media or governmental bureaucracy...Yet Steinbeck’s interest in people and their passions and his keen eye for scenic beauties and social truths infuses his journey with an autumnal sense of satisfaction and grateful joy, making Travels with Charley this master’s most companionable—and beloved—book.",

Human beings are essentially the same around the world; the digestive tract, for example, or the cerebral cortex, is identical from one end of the earth to the other. Yet humans speak thousands of languages. In After Babel, Steiner asks, “Why does this unified, though individually unique mammalian species not use one common language?” Steiner moves comfortably among several languages and seems to have at his command nearly all of world literature. This book, like his others, is riddled with an erudition so comprehensive that it can seem daunting page by page. Yet Steiner’s ability to apply his acumen to fundamental human questions with wit and eloquence makes the rewards of following his intellectual ambitions well worth the effort. ",

The son of a sawmill owner, young Julien has Napoleonic dreams; handsome and clever, he has the gifts to pursue them. Recognizing that the path to glory for an ambitious youth in the France of the Bourbon Restoration runs through religious rather than martial channels, he dons the black robes of the clergy rather than the red uniform of the military. This decision reveals the scheming soul that animates Sorel’s every action, even in the sphere of love. Stendhal is particularly deft at capturing the tumult of lovers’ emotions, their prides and jealousies, anticipations and despairs. In fact, the psychological naturalism with which he depicts Julien’s conspiracy of one—his relentless opportunism in pursuing the unreachable triumphs he imagines are his due—undercuts the romantic sweep of the tale. Stendhal’s realistic style combines with his wry intelligence to treat all that falls into its purview—from the hypocrisy of the church to the petty posturing of both provincial and Parisian society—to a worldly assessment both sardonic and shrewd, making The Red and the Black a pleasure to both read and ponder.",

Their complexity of incident and idea is made compelling by the author’s stunning gift for narrative magic. Despite the gargantuan dimensions of his tomes (many of his novels push a thousand pages), the experience of reading his work is fleet and fun; chasing a Stephenson tale is an exhilarating exercise in enchantment. Quicksilver, the first volume in Stephenson’s Baroque Cycle. begins in colonial Boston in 1713 and travels both backward and forward in time to present an astonishing panorama of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in England, France, and other parts of Europe. Historical figures like Samuel Pepys, the pirate Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard), the cryptologist Rossignol, and assorted dukes and kings cross the paths of our protagonists, and Stephenson treats us to erudite descriptions of the Great Fire of London (1666), the Battle of Vienna (1683), the Pitchfork Rebellion (1685), and the Glorious Revolution (1688). Original, expansive, and immensely enjoyable.",

        "text": "This antic shaggy dog story firmly established itself during the twentieth century as one of the most admired books ever written. Virginia Woolf, for example, hailed it as “the greatest of all novels,” and Czech writer Milan Kundera praised it for reaching “heights of playfulness, of lightness, never scaled before or since.” Tristram Shandy’s levity is irrepressibly apparent even before you start reading: Flip through the book and you’ll see black pages, marbled pages, blank pages, and typographic oddities that, you’ll discover, are visual counterparts to specific moments in the story. In large part that story turns out to be about the protagonist’s difficulty telling it. As digression follows digression, and interruption interrupts interruption, Tristram leads the tale on such a merry dance that it proceeds in every direction but forward. His reflections on matters mundane and philosophical and his accounts of the lives of his father and of his eccentric and often incomprehensible uncle Toby are just a few of the detours that distract him from his own progress, which never gets much past his first three years. But this wayward narrative’s energy never flags, and Laurence Sterne’s self-reflexive novel offers one of literature’s first—and probably its funniest—portrayals of the errant urgencies of consciousness.

Its literary legacy is the exhilaration of pure adventure, and its imaginative one the romantic image of pirates that still animates popular culture (such as the Pirates of the Caribbean films), the essential elements of which—buried treasure, wooden legs, yo-ho- ho and all—made their first impression in Treasure Island.",

        "text": "Although the heroics of Kidnapped’s two protagonists, the narrator David Balfour and the dashing fugitive Alan Breck Stewart, are captivating regardless of one’s knowledge of Scottish history, it does help to know that their thrilling exploits are set in the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden, when English forces ruthlessly defeated Highlander rebels and quelled the Jacobite uprising of 1745. Look what’s possible, Stevenson is saying, when Lowland loyalist (Balfour) and Jacobite Highlander (Stewart) combine forces toward a common goal. The story begins with David’s pursuit of his family inheritance, which pits him against his conniving uncle Ebenezer. Owing to his uncle’s bad offices, David is kidnapped and enslaved on a ship bound for America. An accident at sea lands him in the company of Alan, a rebel on the run from the English authorities and their Scottish enforcers. The two become comrades as they conspire to win their freedom, weather shipwreck and separation, and come together again in the Highlands, keeping one foot ahead of their pursuers as they seek to find a safe haven, clear Alan’s name, and claim David’s rightful legacy. Hiding by day, traveling by night, enduring every kind of hardship and close encounter with their enemies, they survive by their wits and their loyalty to each other. The historical context adds a realistic texture to the fantastic excitement of the pair’s many escapes, and the human currency of their attachment transcends political dogma. The same narrative framework would, in due course, provide the plot for countless thrillers and buddy movies, but it has seldom been better realized than in this, its seminal incarnation.",

Perhaps for the first time in literature, the poet evokes the inner life of early childhood with tender attention and affection.

Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, published in 1886 to a popular acclaim that has not diminished since, is just such a creation, a tale of tantalizing suspense that echoes with disturbing and mysterious psychological resonance. The figure at its core has become an emblem of the duplicity of human nature: intellect and appetite, restraint and transgression, civility and brutality—Jekyll and Hyde. We cannot help but recognize that Jekyll is at every stage protective of his twin, and thus complicit in Hyde’s vice and savage violence: Good cleaves to evil with appalling instinct. Stevenson’s story tells us the world’s horrors are human, and our own. That it remains compelling suggests the mysteries stories can summon and science cannot.",

        "text": "You’re probably familiar with the outlines of the story: A centuries-old vampire lures an English visitor to his castle in Transylvania, then journeys to London to seek fresh blood from his visitor’s paramour—with first mystified, then terrified, and finally horrified pursuers on his trail. But what you may not know is how the formal structure of Stoker’s storytelling adds to the suspense. The initial chapters of the book are told through the journals of the Englishman who makes the trip to the count’s eerie Transylvanian lair, and the rest of the novel portrays the growing fears and awareness of an extended circle of characters through letters, telegrams, newspaper stories, diary entries, and even transcriptions of early phonographic recordings. As episodes and revelations are pieced together, the reader’s apprehension mounts with the discovery of each new wound, corpse, and coffin. Stoker, an Irishman with a love for the stage (for years he managed the London theater company of celebrated actor Henry Irving), based the character of Dracula on elements of Eastern European vampire legends. Although he was not the first to turn such lore to literary profit, his addition of a veiled eroticism and a looming personality—along with a few new qualities, such as his vampire’s lack of reflection in a mirror—created an undead villain for the ages, one who still runs rampant through a century of spin-offs.",

In Fer-de-Lance, the genius must exert his mind as Archie exerts his body to unravel the serpentine connections between the murders of an immigrant laborer and a college president. The case Stout concocts is intricate enough to lend a compelling forward motion through the enchanted atmosphere of Wolfe’s carefully constructed realm. Best of all, the author’s brilliant combination of Wolfe’s mental ingenuity and Goodwin’s street-savvy sleuthing provides readers with the satisfactions of both the classic mystery of intellection and its more hard-boiled cousin.",

The reader is caught up in the strained dynamics of the Underhill family—crushed and sour father Philip, ill-fated mother Nancy, and adolescent questing son Mark—so as to render the supernatural doings that Mark uncovers in a neighbor’s menacing house that much more believable. Straub provides alternate points of view on events past and present, further opening our understanding of his milieu and its denizens. This is a tale with an essential lesson that lingers with a ghostly persistence of its own: Life does not run to our dictates, and we must appreciate whatever it gives, to say nothing of what it takes away.

Led by her famous brothers, novelist Henry and philosopher William, the James family embodied its own peculiar genius: It was a small and vibrant country in the middle of the continent of the nineteenth century. Biographer Jean Strouse explores this country and its natives with detail, discrimination, and insight. She knows her way around the continent as well, and rightly sees in Alice James an intensely private life that nevertheless “makes vivid the ideas, personalities, and social conditions of her time.” The initial sentence of chapter 1 reveals Strouse’s acumen and command of expression, which never flag: “Interesting perceptions are preferable to marketable achievements only where there is enough money to go around.” Biography gets no better than this.",

Beginning with the ascendance of Julius Caesar and the demise of the Roman Republic, and concluding with the tyrannical reign of Domitian, who was assassinated in AD 96, these biographical sketches encompass 150 years of eventful imperial history. In his characteristically and compellingly readable translation, Robert Graves proves the perfect interpreter.",

He has been placed in the company of such twentieth-century writers as James Joyce, Thomas Mann, Robert Musil, and Franz Kafka. But this book is a lot more fun than any of that sounds. Utterly charming in its wry reporting of everyday evasions and emergencies, it proves that a personality that might be exasperating to encounter in real life can be conspiratorially delightful on the page. \n",

        "text": "Gulliver’s Travels is a timeless and universal story, a narrative of bold invention that is laced with satire of a ferocity rarely equaled in the annals of literature. In each of Gulliver’s adventures, Swift, an Irish-born priest whose other writings include poems and essays, satirizes foolishness and vice. His specific targets are now unfamiliar, but his mockery retains its bite because it addresses unchanging aspects of behavior. From the gigantic vanity of the pint-sized Lilliputians to the small-mindedness of the enormous Brobdingnagians, Swift skewers follies as recognizable to us as the faces we see in the mirror. Though the book is rife with page-turning pleasures, Gulliver’s Travels contains some of the most savage criticism of humanity ever penned. That’s especially true of the section devoted to the Houyhnhnms, in which Gulliver, having found an idyllic society of reason and intelligence among the horses, is unable on his return to England to reconcile himself to the proud unpleasantness of his Yahoo-like countrymen. Fiercely funny and terrifically entertaining, Gulliver’s Travels remains a storytelling feat in a class by itself.",

        "text": " “Have you read . . . ?” is a question that sends many readers off on bookish adventures. It sent A. J. A. Symons on a quest that resulted in this pathbreaking biography. “Have you read Hadrian the Seventh?” a friend asked Symons in the summer of 1925. Not having done so, Symons borrowed and read his friend’s copy. In Symons’s opinion, the novel, published in 1904, was “one of the most extraordinary achievements in English literature. . . .” So intrigued was Symons by the unusual personality behind the work that he set out to learn what he could about the author, who was listed as Fr. Rolfe. This turned out to be Frederick William Rolfe (1860–1913), a London-born artist and writer whose many pen names included Baron Corvo. No need here to spoil the pleasure of joining Symons in uncovering the bizarre truth; suffice it to say that you are unlikely to come across a more eccentric, self-destructive genius in literature’s archives. Since 1934, when Symons’s daring “experiment in biography” was published, “in search of” biographies have become more common, but few of them have matched the ingenuity or thrilling allure of The Quest for Corvo.",

Virtuosic in their playful simplicity and virtuous in their philosophical and ethical seriousness, her poems evoke the deep yet often unconscious contemplative spirit that hovers over the inconsequential details of our mundane activities. Whether writing about a bodybuilder’s contest, a bird, or a birthday, her conversational voice captures the way the flotsam and jetsam of our days are caught in deep tides of time, fate, love, and individual morality.",

He also brought a respect for the values of republican Rome that colored his accounts of imperial excess and corruption. The image of ancient turpitude later encapsulated in the phrase “decline and fall” was first sketched in the Histories and the Annals. For Tacitus, moral degradation was the inevitable result of the loss of freedom that the autocratic rule of the emperors—to say nothing of their personal depravities—introduced into Roman governance. Lively, smart, stylish, the works of Tacitus remain, after two thousand years, hard to put down.",

Talese’s journalism, especially as practiced in the pages of Esquire magazine, brought him wide acclaim and would prove uncommonly influential. The Sinatra piece in particular—in which the author offers a finely etched portrait of the mercurial singer despite the fact that Sinatra’s cold (or the excuse it affords) keeps him from ever sitting for an interview—has earned an extraordinary reputation. Fame and Obscurity offers similarly insightful perspectives on figures theatrical (Joshua Logan and Peter O’Toole), pugilistic (Floyd Patterson and Joe Louis), criminal (Frank Costello), and journalistic (Diana Vreeland, George Plimpton and company, and Alden Whitman, fabled New York Times obituary writer).",

        "text": "The magic of Awago Beach, the vacation destination for the families of the two adolescent girls, Rose and Windy, whose friendship is at the heart of This One Summer, is pretty mundane. “My dad says Awago is a place where beer grows on trees and everyone can sleep in until eleven,” Rose, the narrator, confides. Her summertime pal is a year and a half younger, less alert than Rose to the allure of boys or the enticing holiday freedom older teens enjoy. Yet the girls remain inseparable as they make their rounds in the humble, slightly ramshackle town, a lakeside agglomeration of cabins and conveniences. The writing is the work of Mariko Tamaki, and her cousin Jillian Tamaki draws the graphic novel’s art. The naturalistic illustration, ever-so-slightly tinged with anime influences, has a captivating palette of blues. Glorious features of physical reality or human expression fill each page. Although, as the title suggests, this is one summer, its focus frees it to represent the fleeting particularities of what becomes our most treasured experiences; it’s the genius of the Tamakis’ book to depict the desultory richness of a summer vacation as it’s happening—long before the nostalgia that’s waiting to happen kicks in.",

        "text": "Thirty-six-year-old Jing-mei, also known as June, hasn’t been to her mother’s mah jong club since she was a teenager. Her father has asked her to take the seat at the table which has been empty since her mother died two months earlier. Arriving at the house of one of the “aunties” who occupy the other three corners of the Joy Luck Club, she is dismayed by the sameness—nothing has changed in the apartment; the aunties and uncles still follow their decades-old routines—and yet she feels completely out of place. Jing-mei has always been embarrassed by her mother and her friends and their persistence in their nostalgic ways. As Jing-mei takes her seat at the table, her mother’s stories come back to her, and as The Joy Luck Club progresses, Tan moves around the table, unfolding the lives of the aunties and their grown daughters. The deftly woven web of tales and tellers catches all the women’s hopes and heartaches, dreams and disappointments, some especially Chinese American, others the lot of immigrants of any nationality, almost all familiar to mothers and daughters everywhere. Encouraged by the older women, Jing-mei travels to China to reconnect with those her mother left behind, allowing Tan to close a magical narrative circle that is warm and wonderful in its embrace of family, forgiveness, and the joy and luck that can redeem misfortune.",

The Tao’s eighty-one brief chapters fall into two parts. The first emphasizes the cosmic Way and applies it to the person (sections 1 through 37 in most translations); the second (sections 38–81) focuses on how individual character and virtue determine one’s progress along the Way. The destination of this philosophical journey is a kind of stoicism that relies on serenity rather than strength, engendering a spirit that is poised rather than purposeful. The path the book’s teachings map out encourages us to dispense with habits that hold us hostage to individual will and social and cultural frameworks, so that we may learn again, quietly and without striving, to simply be.",

Despite this revelation at the outset, her story of a coterie of classics majors from an elite New England college delivers the satisfactions of a thriller— a thriller with a literary pedigree, but a thriller nonetheless. The Secret History is an evocation of lost friendship, lost promise, lost passion, and lost youth, in which the time before the losing is brilliantly conjured. There is plenty of lost learning as well, as the worldly unworldliness of her protagonists is made dangerous by the intoxications of ancient rites and ideas. The group’s cultish devotion to a priestly professor leads them into snares that hide in plain sight, like the traps foretold in Greek tragic drama. Yet the hypnotic horror of Tartt’s tale has the seductiveness of tragedy’s stepchild, melodrama; its allure casts a narrative spell that imbues callow lives with an eerie, uneasy attractiveness.",

Let’s start with the fact that although a reader can rather easily assemble a sizable library of foreign visitors’ excellently written accounts of sojourns in Venice, Florence, and Rome, books that wander off those deservedly beaten urban paths are fewer and farther between. The unexpected purview of Edith Templeton’s 1954 travel diary—which its subtitle announces as “one woman’s adventures in Cremona, Parma, Mantua, Ravenna, Urbino and Arezzo”—is just one of several qualities that sets it apart. Even in the age of e-books and easy internet searches for forgotten volumes, The Surprise of Cremona is nearly impossible to find, but it is well worth seeking out—just like the best restaurants in strange provincial towns, which the author learns are usually discovered by heading down back streets and hidden alleys. How apt.",

        "text": "Scotland Yard Detective Inspector Alan Grant is a sleuth whose consummate professionalism is all the more intriguing given his particular mix of flaws and flair. A triumph of ingenuity, The Daughter of Time finds Grant confined to a hospital bed but nevertheless investigating a couple of five-hundred-year-old homicides: the killing of the princes in the tower by the villainous Richard III. According to tradition and the damning pentameter of Shakespeare, Richard was motivated by monstrous ambition—yet when Grant studies a portrait of the malign king, he sees a sensitive face incapable of such atrocities. Tey, who wears her own learning lightly, illustrates along the way how historical truth—“the daughter of time” in an old proverb—can become so tangled in legend that it becomes victim to the human imagination. It’s a lesson most delightfully delivered.",

        "text": "Of all the celebrated nineteenth-century British novels, Vanity Fair is the most twenty-first century in scope and style. A gleeful satire of upper-class hypocrisy and every-class avarice in the early 1800s, during the era of the Napoleonic wars, Thackeray’s panoramic comedy takes its title from Pilgrim’s Progress by John Bunyan (1628–1688). In Bunyan’s allegorical tale about living a Christian life, Vanity is the name of a town where worldly prizes and honors are sold at a fair rather than earned through good conduct. To Thackeray, the Vanity Fair is society itself, where greed, corruption, pride, and “dismal roguery” rule the mad scramble for temporal glory. Fast paced and thoroughly entertaining, his story traces the fortunes of good but naïve Amelia Sedley, who is overshadowed in every way by her scheming and seductive friend Becky Sharp. Charming, clever, beautiful, and engagingly amoral, Becky is one of literature’s great creations, a bad girl who makes for very good reading. Few writers have been able to match Thackeray’s flair for making an education in the ways of the world so engaging and instructive; his riveting, rollicking Vanity Fair remains in a class by itself.",

Anything but workmanlike, his essays on packing fruit, hauling sacks of coffee, work rules, unions, and Sisyphus, the laborer’s patron saint, are elegant, funny, and wise.

Its 250,000 square miles in the southeast corner of the Arabian Peninsula include parts of Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen, and the United Arab Emirates. As a twentieth-century adventurer, Wilfred Thesiger was in a class by himself. Naturalist David Attenborough correctly described him as “one of the very few people who in our time could be put on the pedestal of the great explorers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.” His years in the Empty Quarter certainly offered the author the chance to truly test himself, as his many descriptions of thirst, hunger, and hostile conditions reveal. They also gave him the opportunity to become intimately familiar with the vanishing way of life of the Bedouin. This familiarity informs his narrative with fascinating details of the customs of his Bedu companions, as well as verbal portraits of the desert landscape, all rendered in well-made, watchful prose that shares the visual sensibility evidenced in Thesiger’s excellent photographs (several of which appear in most editions of the book).",

In the best examples of the form, the essayist communicates not just learning, but thinking, inviting the reader to share the satisfactions of a mind at play on a field of observation or experience. When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight.",

His magnum opus—and at more than a thousand pages it is indeed magnum—springs from a mind conversant with natural philosophy from Aristotle to Darwin and with mathematical ideas from Pythagoras to Newton and beyond. Thompson writes about the development of form and structure in living organisms in prose that gracefully assimilates all the strands of his learning into a truly cultured whole, both sonorous and substantive. Identifying mathematical patterns and mechanical forces where strict proponents of evolutionary theory would see only biological imperatives, On Growth and Form surveys a rich variety of specimens—cells, eggs, shells, jellyfish, skeletons—to reveal the abstract elegance and impulses of the physical world. Thompson‘s portrait of nature has inspired artists and architects as well as mathematicians and scientists for nearly a century.",

Its charming remembrance of local customs, crafts, and culture is distinguished by its fidelity to the roaming curiosity of a child’s eye, as an early passage illustrates: \"One old woman once handed the little girl a leaf from a pot-plant on her window-sill. 'What’s it called?' was the inevitable question. 'Tis called mind your own business,' was the reply; 'an’ I think I’d better give a slip of it to your mother to plant in a pot for you.”' What’s most pleasing about Thompson’s writing is the easy confidence of her affectionate portrayal of times past. Farmers and traveling vendors, family and schoolwork, seasonal festivals and the small matters of community life are recalled, and the natural beauty of the English countryside is quietly honored by exact description. This is not only a book that evokes a lost world, but one that transports us to a simpler era with clarity and calm attention.",

Thompson and a sidekick on a journalistic assignment in 1971. It’s a book of headlong prose, reckless conduct, and delirious inspiration. The backstory in brief: Thompson was commissioned by Sports Illustrated to attend a motorcycle race in Las Vegas and write a short item about it. He went to Vegas as promised, but that’s where all resemblance to normal journalism ended. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was first published as a two-part series in Rolling Stone, where British artist Ralph Steadman’s bizarre slash-and-splatter illustrations proved the perfect visual counterpart to Thompson’s compelling stylistic bravura. Thus was born the “gonzo journalism” that Thompson practiced for the rest of his influential writing career—although he would never again, frankly, “gonzo” anywhere near as memorably as he did in this outlandish tour de force.",

Thompson’s small heroine inhabits the ultimate urban wonderland: the swanky Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. With her mother perennially off in Paris, Eloise is ensconced in a penthouse suite at the Plaza with her Nanny, her dog, Weenie, and her turtle, Skipperdee. The result is a delicious romp through a world peopled with aristocrats and hotel staff, who all seem more or less oblivious to Eloise’s revels. Decades after its creation, Thompson’s book retains its infectious allure, the humor and energy of its telling abetted and amplified on every page by Hilary Knight’s marvelous illustrations.",

        "text": "Henry David Thoreau is the friendliest of philosophers, in no small part because his search for life’s meaning was conducted with a first-person simplicity that gives his quest a narrative appeal: “I went to the woods,” he writes of his famous sojourn at Walden Pond, “because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.” Culled from his copious journals, his thoughts are assembled into discrete chapters—“Where I Lived, and What I Lived For,” “Reading,” “Solitude,” “Visitors,” “The BeanField,” “The Village,” “Winter Animals,” and “Spring,” to name a sampling. His close observations of the world about him—take the catalog of noises, from train whistle to cock’s crow, so faithfully rehearsed in “Sounds”—summon from his pen warnings about the conformist habits of society as well as rhapsodies about the liberating energies of nature. A profound influence on environmentalists, economists, rebels, and activists, Walden remains a tonic for any pensive reader trying to make sense of his or her own necessities.",

        "text": "Born a generation after Herodotus, Thucydides chose a different tack in his approach to writing history. His account of the epic struggle between Athens and the Peloponnesians (Sparta and its allies), a conflict that lasted nearly three decades (431 to 404 BC), focuses on political and military issues to the exclusion of the wandering curiosity and ethnographic concerns that characterized the Histories of Herodotus. Thucydides begins his history of the war “at the moment it broke out,” and his readiness to collect and compare eyewitness accounts of the various campaigns combines with his direct, incisive style to make his book lively reading. To sample Thucydides at his best, go straight to his intricate account of the Athenians’ invasion of Sicily and their ultimate defeat by the Spartans at Syracuse (books 6 and 7): “This was the greatest Hellenic achievement of any in this war, or, in my opinion, in Hellenic history; at once most glorious to the victors, and most calamitous to the conquered.”",

        "text": "Humorist James Thurber was a true American original. Born in Ohio and for decades on the staff of The New Yorker, he created in his stories and drawings a world uniquely his own. Among the stories, the most famous is undoubtedly “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.” This brief tale reveals that even a meek and hen-pecked husband may harbor adventure-packed daydreams. Mitty-esque men are also much in evidence in Thurber’s priceless drawings. One of the best-known Thurber cartoons, captioned “House and Woman,” shows just such an unimposing fellow at the moment he reaches home and is startled to find that the house itself is actually becoming his scowling wife. In addition to harried, befuddled men and the women who loom over them, dogs and other animals are constant presences in the Thurber universe. The Thurber Carnival is an anthology whose table of contents reads like a roster of the high points of modern American humor, for the volume generously proffers samples from seven of Thurber’s books, including My World and Welcome to It, The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze, and Men, Women and Dogs.",

        "text": "Timerman’s family moved to Argentina from the Ukraine when he was five. With the newspapers he founded in Buenos Aires, most notably La Opinión, and his frequent presence on radio and television, he was one of the country’s most vocal champions of human rights. Yet his visibility did not prevent him from becoming a victim of the military junta and its “Dirty War,” the culmination of Argentina’s frightful and tumultuous political climate in the 1970s. Early on the morning of April 15, 1977, Timerman was arrested by twenty armed men in civilian clothes. Without being charged, he was thrown into prison; for thirty months, he underwent physical and psychological torture. His ordeal became the subject of international attention and ended not in death, as it did for thousands of others subjected to similar mistreatment, but in release and deportation. In the aftermath, he wrote this powerful account of his experience. From its description of the vistas of freedom seen through a peephole in his dark cell to its compelling account of the uncertain final hours of his captivity, this book’s evocation of the plight of a prisoner—stripped not only of his human rights, but nearly of his very humanity—is unforgettable.",

Herself a householder in Chassignoles, Tindall there came upon a cache of letters dating from the 1860s addressed to Célestine Chaumette (1844–1933), the village innkeeper’s daughter. The letters—saved by Célestine throughout her long life—were by different hands, and pressed the marriage proposals of a number of ardent but ultimately unsuccessful suitors. Intrigued by the letters and their recipient, Tindall employed her wiles as both historian and novelist to flesh out the history they intimated. The resulting volume not only remembers the life of Célestine, but movingly reveals the unrecorded destiny of Chassignoles as well, evoking the fate of thousands of places like it—places that house, within the silence of their modern aspects, the spirits of a vanished past.",

        "text": "Most authors of fiction lead comparatively sedate, even humdrum lives. Seated alone at their desks for hours each day, or lecturing in snoozy classrooms, they seldom get a chance to venture out into the wide world of endeavor and adventure. Not so for Alice Bradley Sheldon, who wrote science fiction as James Tiptree Jr. Raised by globetrotting parents, she can be seen in vintage photographs as a toddler consorting with African wildlife. As an adult, she worked for the CIA (an occupation she shared with another science fiction master, Cordwainer Smith) and then got a doctorate in experimental psychology. Although she produced two novels, Tiptree’s brilliance resides in the sharp shock of her short fiction, works that might be well described as clawed, fanged, and spitting. Deploying a sophisticated style in the service of deep characterizations, she was not afraid to embrace topics formerly taboo, adding a feminist slant deemed exceptional in a “male” writer, one whose tough-minded and sometimes brutal realism only strengthened the power of her disguise. Although she published several story collections in her lifetime, the posthumous volume Her Smoke Rose Up Forever gathers much of her best work and is a stellar survey of her talent; its eighteen stories convey the hardheaded, despairing, compassionate, and even playful mind behind the mask.

        "text": "The book originated in a nine-month journey that Tocqueville made through the eastern United States in 1831. Accompanied by a fellow Frenchman, the young aristocrat (he was just turning twenty-six) was ostensibly investigating the country’s prison system. The real point of the journey, however, was “to see what a great republic is.” As he says, “I confess that in America I saw more than America; I sought the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress.” Tocqueville focused on the meaning and actual functioning of democracy, studying its effect on the social, political, and economic life of Americans. His intuitions as a thinker and his astute observations are apparent throughout his consideration of myriad topics, among them the philosophical underpinnings of the democratic impulse, religion, the arts, language, the press, individualism, manners, the family, the military, and law and the judiciary. The result was—and remains—a more complete and insightful portrait of the United States than any observer has ever painted.",

Tolkien, a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, scribbled a sentence while correcting some student papers: “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.” Those ten words are the seed from which grew a complex and elaborate mythology that would captivate the imaginations of millions of readers throughout the world before spawning, some three decades after Tolkien’s death, a movie and entertainment franchise of fantastic dimensions, in every sense that adjective conveys. The hobbit Tolkien discovered at the end of his now famous scribbled sentence (it’s the first line of this book) is named Bilbo Baggins. One day Bilbo’s peaceful, lazy existence is interrupted by the arrival at his comfortable hobbit-hole of a wizard named Gandalf, who manages to lure the unassuming hobbit into an escapade being planned by thirteen dwarves. Their perilous quest: to regain possession of the Lonely Mountain and its fabulous treasure, which Smaug the dragon has seized from their ancestors. Bilbo reluctantly joins the daring band, and in the end, after harrowing encounters with an extraordinary assortment of invented creatures, including goblins, elves, wargs, trolls, sages, giant spiders, and the subterranean, riddling Gollum, he returns home with a modest fortune—and a piece of jewelry with dangerous powers: the One Ring.",

Tolkien’s hero, Frodo, is the adoptive heir of Bilbo Baggins, protagonist of The Hobbit. The narrative traverses many milieus and social strata, from the simplicity of the Hobbit Shire to the ethereal elegance of the Elvish pavilions at Rivendell, from the martial court of Gondor to the evil precincts of Sauron’s Mordor (infused with the author’s philological wizardry, the names of places and characters offer delights of their own). Contrasting camaraderie with selfishness, megalomania with humility, and tradition with destruction, the story maintains a dialectical tension throughout a series of rousing adventures, keeping the longed-for triumph of good hanging by a thread over a literal abyss of fire. Books in Tolkien’s mold have emerged from the usual mix of commercial and aesthetic motives, but the breadth and depth of his trilogy’s conception remains unmatched: The Lord of the Rings exists like a mountain transported from another dimension, cloaked in preexisting fauna and flora, with exotic and familiar forms of feeling animating its every crevice, cave, and peak.",

Its juxtaposition of universal verity with particular insight sets the tone for the eight hundred pages that follow. Anna Karenina is intimate—a tale of families and lovers, their obligations to one another, the costs of both betraying and upholding unspoken codes of behavior. The novel is a gloriously detailed and absorbing portrait of the lives of the nineteenth-century Russian aristocracy, but that’s not why it’s so popular: Its power over readers endures because Tolstoy’s sympathy for men and women and his stunning psychological acuity are without rival. Legend has it that when he was asked to name the three greatest novels of all time, William Faulkner, whose fiction could not be less like Tolstoy’s, answered, “Anna Karenina. Anna Karenina. Anna Karenina.” You’ll see why. ",

        "text": "The story begins with the announcement at the law courts of Ivan Ilych’s death; his former colleagues greet the news with rote expressions of grief, keen attention to what the news might mean for their own advancement, and no little annoyance at the disruption to their routines caused by the demands of condolence and funeral services. Tolstoy then gives a compressed description (the entire novella is roughly eighty pages long) of the deceased’s personal life and professional career, a familiar narration of youthful enthusiasms diffused by the demands of workplace and family until they’ve faded into a colorless and unfulfilling middle age in which a “new apartment is always one room too small, and a new income always 50 rubles short.” Thinking neither about the laws of history nor the romantic passions that can turn private lives upside down, but rather brooding upon the determined loneliness and utter commonness of a single fearful man, Tolstoy paradoxically homes in on the most universal questions: Why must we suffer the horror of mortality? What’s the right way to live in the face of our ultimate extinction? What’s it all for? His severe yet sacramental attention to these mysteries makes the eighty-odd pages of The Death of Ivan Ilych as riveting and unforgettable as the hundreds upon hundreds of pages that compose his larger-than-life masterpieces.",

        "text": "A monument of world literature and a reader’s rite of passage, War and Peace is among the longest works of fiction ever written. Its thirteen hundred pages blend private emotions and public events, love affairs and military campaigns, personality and history into a narrative that—as Tolstoy himself struggled to explain—is strictly speaking neither novel, nor epic, nor historical chronicle, nor philosophical inquiry; rather, it inherits characteristics of all four to embody an expressive life entirely its own. A large part of the grandeur of War and Peace derives from two innovations. Not only does Tolstoy mix fictional characters with real-life figures drawn from scrupulous historical research, but he also shifts back and forth between bird’s-eye-view narration of enormous events—military battles, lavish parties—and interior monologues of penetrating psychological awareness. War and Peace is such a huge and extraordinary achievement that it is surprising to realize that it is the work of a young author. When it was first serialized in a Russian magazine (under the working title “The Year 1805”), Tolstoy was only in his late thirties. He completed the work at age forty-one. For all Tolstoy’s later accomplishments, nothing he would write—not even the majestic Anna Karenina—compares to War and Peace. What’s true of its form is true of the reading experience it creates: You live this book as much as you read it, and to recapture the engrossing sensation, you can only read it again.",

The absence of sunlight is metaphorical as well as real, for Tomlinson, at the time a reporter on the London Morning Leader, is despondent about the constraints of his daily prospects. But then, to Tomlinson’s surprise and the reader’s ultimate reward, unexpected opportunity knocks, and almost before he knows it,\nhe is on a train to Swansea in Wales, ready to board a freighter bound for the upper reaches of the Amazon. Tomlinson’s voice, so engaging in the opening chapter, only gains dimension and perspective when confronted with the liberating exertions of a voyage and the natural wonders of the equatorial jungle. Describing flora, fauna, landscape, and native companions with unerring alertness and élan, he composes a narrative that is itself refreshing and spirit-lifting. Don’t miss it.",

He spent much of his life in Devon, where he came to inhabit his grandfather’s house at Wreyland. There he listened to his neighbors, considered their customs, consulted the copious diaries and letters left to him by his father and grandfather, and mined his own travel journals to catalog, in poised paragraphs and circumscribed vignettes, whatever occupied his mind. His eye for the comic, together with his affection for both his shared locality and his private legacies of family lore and worldly learning, make Small Talk at Wreyland an ideal and engaging personal testament to the passing pageant of the years—and a desultory reader’s delight.",

Didn’t you know that the life of storybook characters goes on even once their books are closed? Well, as we learn in this ingenious novel, such characters are just as surprised to find out that readers have a life apart from their reading. “You mean you don’t know how your own story turns out?” Sylvie asks Claire, the young girl who becomes entranced by Sylvie’s tale, then rescues the princess and her fellow characters when the volume they have inhabited for eight decades—since Claire’s grandmother possessed it as a child—is threatened by fire. As the resourceful Sylvie escapes the borders of her book to enter Claire’s dreams and take up sometimes perilous residence in the girl’s imagination, real young readers—and their parents, if they’re lucky—are bound to become lost in one of the most inventive and exhilarating narratives they’ll ever discover. Filled with surprise and magnanimous wisdom, The Great Good Thing is a marvelous invocation of the power of books to transcend time and pass enchantments across generations.",

But it is Traherne’s prose that is truly distinctive: Visionary and magnificent, it has no parallel in the annals of English literature. A collection of four sets of one hundred meditations (plus a fifth that is only partially complete), Centuries of Meditations is a devotional work consisting of brief passages—in most instances less than a page—that focus on Christian belief and ethics and on the nature of God and divine love. Throughout, they display the author’s dedication to a philosophy of “felicity.” No one but Wordsworth has evoked with such passionate invention the joy of childhood, or written with such faith that the wonder of its innocence could be approached and experienced again despite the disenchantments of experience.",

        "text": "Beginning with the great man’s return from his stint as a candlemaker in New York to his craggy home base on Caprera, an inhospitable island off the coast of Sardinia, Garibaldi and the Thousand culminates with Garibaldi’s successful expedition to Sicily in 1860, a turning point in the formation of modern Italy. With one thousand volunteers, he wrested Palermo, the Sicilian capital, away from much larger Bourbon forces with a combination of boldness, bravery, and military genius. Garibaldi’s legendary ability to inspire devotion in his often ragtag troops (and, as the reader of Trevelyan soon becomes aware, in at least one erudite English historian) is wonderfully conveyed, as are the moral reserves and pragmatic intelligence that checked the hero’s personal and political ambitions. Indeed, Garibaldi’s character is so complex that he would have been a perfect protagonist for an opera by his contemporary, Giuseppe Verdi.",

While Trevor’s wide-ranging tales encompass everything from American expatriates to Italian innkeepers and the English upper class, his best rehearse the yearnings and regrets of ordinary Irish men and women, trapped by circumstance—and the poignant comfort of their own habituation to their fate—into lives of want in all the ample meanings of that word. In his understated yet exact descriptions of the sorrows that define the days of nondescript yet often honorable people, Trevor plots the boundless and bewildering capacity of the human heart, no matter how faint its beating. Sound bleak? Perhaps. But taken one at a time, Trevor’s stories are stunning in the shared sadnesses they evoke, and heartwarming in strange, startling ways.",

        "text": "In the summer of 1973, under cloak-and-dagger circumstances, distinguished historian and Oxford don Hugh Trevor-Roper came into possession of two remarkable manuscripts by Sir Edmund Trelawny Backhouse (1873–1944). Backhouse, a China scholar long resident in Peking, was known as coauthor of a couple of standard works on Chinese history and as a singular benefactor of Oxford’s Bodleian Library, to which he had presented a magnificent collection of some 27,000 Chinese books and manuscripts. It was not, however, this respected and admired Backhouse who was the subject of the uncovered memoirs that soon had Trevor-Roper under their spell. Instead, a completely unexpected figure came to light, for the pair of startlingly obscene manuscripts recorded in detail an extraordinary life, one that “touched, at so many points, the literary and social history of late Victorian England and late Manchu China” and included intimate acquaintance with the likes of French poet Paul Verlaine, Oscar Wilde, and the Dowager Empress of China. The “elusive and preposterous character” who emerged from Trevor-Roper’s investigations into Backhouse’s real and imagined lives turns out to have been one of the most outrageous frauds of the age. As recounted by the often perplexed but always fascinated Trevor-Roper, this true story within a story within a story makes, in the words of novelist Robert Nye, for “one of those rare books which, once begun, you have to finish in a single night.” ",

The title character, the Reverend Septimus Harding, is a good and gentle man who runs a hospital for pensioners in a provincial town. The institution is supported by a charitable trust that comes under the scrutiny of a young reformer, outraged by the unequal distribution of proceeds between Mr. Harding’s living and the hospital itself. The kerfuffle is complicated by the fact that Mr. Harding is both beloved by his neighbors and diligent in discharging his responsibilities, and all the more entangled because the energetic reformer is in love with the warden’s daughter. Despite the fuller pleasures of Trollope’s later books, The Warden is the place to begin one’s exploration of the large canvas on which he explores, with empathy and irony, the complex relations of people, property, and position that transcend their local settings to both delight and instruct us.",

Although we have progressed into the realm of another electronic kingdom, the book’s insights may be even more pertinent for the digital age. Trow’s anatomy of American melancholy is cranky, passionate, poignant, knotty, and brilliant: He dissects our public destiny since the 1940s with unrelenting verve, as if he were the ghostwriter for some postmodern revival of the Old Testament books of prophecy. Invoking an extraordinary range of intuitions and references, this small, singular book leads us through “the decline of adulthood” and “the adolescent orthodoxy,” from the World’s Fair of 1964 to the defining force of People magazine to—not last and not least—the faded fortune of the fedora. Everything that passes before Trow’s gaze is illuminated, as the reader’s intelligence and experience will be, by the author’s rage and rue. One can only imagine what he would have made of Facebook.",

As she charts the opening gambits of the war and the strategies and tactics of the early encounters, she offers incisive, illuminating accounts of the frontline advances and backchannel maneuverings that led to the Allied pursuit of the German battle cruiser Goeben through the Mediterranean, the German invasion of Belgium, the Battle of Liège, the burning of the city of Louvain, and, eventually, the tragedy of the Marne. Winston Churchill characterized the first thirty days of World War I as “a drama never surpassed.” The Guns of August tells us why.",

Scott Turow’s inspired plotting continually reveals fresh and shifting perspectives on familiar aspects of the murder mystery, and his deft handling of subplots both political and personal makes Presumed Innocent an extraordinarily satisfying, psychologically acute novel. Although it has spawned many imitations (including Turow’s own later, excellent but less innovative works), it remains a standout.",

Cataloging stupidity, self-deception, and all manner of human frailty, the letters set the stage for the other short works gathered between these covers, which express disdain and derision for the Christian pieties of Twain’s time and for conventional religious thinking generally. Emboldened by a despair exacerbated by age, debt, and the loss of his wife and a daughter, the Mark Twain on display in these writings is ready to question any received wisdom with vigorous skepticism. Dark humor has seldom been so mordant, incisive, and thought-provoking.",

Kidnapped by his alcoholic and abusive father, Huck fakes his own death and flees to an island, where he meets up with Jim, a slave on the run toward his own freedom. The pair’s adventures on a raft on the Mississippi and their encounters with various threatening characters and circumstances provide the heart of the book. Whereas The Adventures of Tom Sawyer was an idyll of remembered childhood, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel of real and present dangers: violence, abuse, oppression, greed, murder, fear. That Twain’s telling is charming as well as troubling is a measure of the author’s skill at spinning tales.",

The battle lines between youthful high spirits and the sober strictures of adult society are quickly drawn, and we know immediately whose side we’re on. The book is based on the author’s recollections of his own youth in Hannibal, Missouri, although these are embellished, naturally, with imaginative flair. All in all, Twain’s debut novel is a delightful evocation of the spirit that drives precocious youngsters to set themselves against the stultifying routines of the grown-up world, wrapped up in a plot that is filled with humor and suspense in equal measure.",

As the book opens, her son Ezra is sorting through her things, describing photos to her that send her thoughts back to the 1940s, when her traveling-salesman husband up and left her. It took her several years to tell the children he was not just away on business, and she recalls struggling to provide for them while hiding the truth, toiling as a grocery cashier to keep them fed, even as they never appreciated her sacrifices. But as the story shifts from Pearl’s recollections to the children’s, all three now middle-aged and struggling with the vicissitudes of their own adulthoods, we find they remember her not as a saint but as something of a monster, their young selves not always nurtured but sometimes lastingly scarred. Tyler calibrates the dearness of family in both senses, illustrating how the deepest affections are both the sweetest and the most costly. Her keen sensitivity to this duality is what gives her books their singular flavor; she knows that the real impediments we face are the circularities, the stuck-in-place-ness, of our lives.",

Their subjects include the programming life, the first internet bubble, artificial intelligence, and broader cultural effects of the digital revolution. Although they were composed over more than two decades, the pieces coalesce into one absorbing and surprising conversation with a mind characterized by integrity and empathy. More importantly, despite the fact that their purview is technical, these essays reveal an author alert to nuance and on good terms with the literary graces. Imagine Virginia Woolf setting out to write “A Machine of One’s Own” and you won’t be far off the scent. Making the recent history of technology a shared experience is precisely what Ullman does brilliantly in these pages, which are filled with impressions, ideas, and sentences that will stop your mind in its tracks, then set it going again with new energy and intelligence.",

As the trilogy opens, Kristin is a young girl devoted to her father and admired by her fellow townspeople. Betrothed by her family to a local landowner’s son, she falls in love with a disreputable man and, sacrificing her family’s affection and the respect of her neighbors, runs away with him. Undset brilliantly portrays the struggle between Kristin’s ardent desire and the compromises, both practical and moral, it engenders. The story progresses across a broad canvas of medieval life as the couple lives through harmony and discord, raises seven sons, confronts issues of religion, politics, and status, and eventually returns to Kristin’s home to face rejection and estrangement. A summary does not do justice to Undset’s achievement, nor to the singularity of her central character, who maintains a riveting identity in the midst of her struggles with family, community, and convention.",

Yet considered together, these short stories offer a probing, astute, and often poignant anatomy of a marriage that is remarkable both as a literary record and a cultural portrait of a tumultuous period in American domestic life. Although Updike portrays the same themes on a much grander scale in his justly acclaimed sequence of Rabbit Angstrom novels, The Maples Stories, in their fleeting intimacy and atmosphere of amorous regret, distill the author’s gift for evoking emotional uncertainty into an exquisitely moving testament.",

The several hundred pieces of correspondence he penned (often with accompanying illustrations; look for an edition that reproduces at least some of these) are the primary source of our knowledge of his life; they also provide a kind of real-time witness to his thinking about his work. Together they constitute the dramatic and compelling autobiography of a strong, sorrowful, sensitive vision searching for sustenance from life’s daily bread.",

Although Vasari’s biographies are more journalistic than scholarly, two important innovations run through them and, by virtue of his work’s influence, through much of the art history that followed him. The first, easy to take for granted today, represents an enormous achievement. With no illustrations in the earliest editions of his book, Vasari had to find a vocabulary to discuss the momentous art produced by his subjects: disegno, for example, meaning the capacity to combine skill in drawing with a larger sense of design; grazia, or grace; and, in acute appreciation of Michelangelo’s intensity of execution and expression, terribilità. Second, he traced a progressive arc from Cimabue to Michelangelo in sophistication and expression that exalted the Florentine artistic legacy and has governed most people’s appreciation of Renaissance art ever since. He had a very good eye, and a very agile pen.",

And although Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is now considerably more than a hundred years old, it is still a thrilling and wonderfully entertaining fantasy of deep-sea adventure. When it comes to describing life beneath the waves, Verne mixes reported fact with his own luxuriant imaginings; it’s the latter that keep the book fresh. And although Verne was prophetic in some ways, including about the military use of submarines, the real reason to read Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is to be on board as a master storyteller sounds the watery deep.",

        "text": "Written out of chronological sequence and gathered together after the fact under the rubrics “Narratives of Empire” or “The American Chronicle,” Gore Vidal’s lively, fact-based fictions—Burr (1973), Lincoln (1984), 1876 (1976), Empire (1987), Hollywood (1990), Washington, D.C. (1964), and The Golden Age (2000)—are an astonishingly engaging course in our nation’s past. The author’s urge to debunk with insider’s insight the personalities of the powerful adds piquancy to his portraits of grandees from Washington and Jefferson to Henry Adams, William Randolph Hearst, and Franklin Roosevelt. But this book, devoted to the exploits of Aaron Burr (1756–1836), is in a class by itself. In Vidal’s depiction, Burr is charming (marrying a rich widow despite his advanced years), savvy (leveraging his connection to the current occupant of the office of vice president, Martin Van Buren, who may or may not be his illegitimate son), and scheming (he still has eyes for a large parcel of land in Texas). Best of all, Burr is wholly fascinating as he shares his memories with the book's narrator, Charlie Schuyler, replete with unflattering intelligence regarding his legendary comrades in the early years of our federal government (none of whom impressed Burr). Witty and enlivened with intrigue throughout, Burr is, quite simply, a joy to read.",

Virgil’s celebration of the great city and the grandeur of Aeneas’s civilizing mission is tempered by his sensitivity to the human price such greatness exacts. Written in the reign of the emperor Augustus during the last decade of the author’s life, the work, although nearly complete in twelve books, was unfinished at the time of Virgil’s death in 19 BC. It remains a whole and satisfying reading experience nonetheless. Although it sings of arms and the man—as its first words (Arma virumque cano) famously announce—and of acts of courage and heroism, Virgil’s epic is notable for its veneration of Aeneas’s Roman virtues: devotion to family, loyalty to homeland, piety, duty.",

        "text": "Voltaire was in many ways the guiding spirit of the eighteenth-century European Enlightenment. His collected works run to 150 volumes. But Candide, for all its brevity, is his magnum opus. This darkly comic narrative reads like a surreal version of a medieval book of marvels, in which all the signs and wonders the hero encounters in his travels are calamities, each one more gruesome than the last. The novella is more like a musical composition of theme and variation than a conventional literary work: Recurring motifs of hope and despair color but never slow the piece’s brisk, brilliant tempo. No matter what larger plots history, theology, and nature may devise, Voltaire suggests, our only solace resides in a private plot of our own, as the tale’s famous closing line, spoken by Candide, concludes: “We must cultivate our garden.”",

Kurt Vonnegut, an American soldier being held there as a prisoner of war, survived because he was confined to Schlachthof-fünf—slaughterhouse number five, an airtight, impregnable underground meat locker. When the future author and his fellow prisoners emerged from their shelter, they found a landscape of unimaginable destruction and were put to work unearthing corpses from the ruins. This strange and compelling novel is the tale that Vonnegut eventually crafted from the horror of his Dresden experience. The profound effect Slaughterhouse-Five had on its first generation of readers—and its continuing resonance—stems from the elaborate phantasmagorical web that Vonnegut weaves around this gruesome reality. In Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut created an uncompromisingly idiosyncratic, intensely affecting work that not only reflected but also helped shape antiwar and counterculture sentiments of the late 1960s; it remains offbeat and eloquent today.",

        "text": "In this lovely and absorbing book, Susan Vreeland traces a putative Vermeer creation—Girl in Hyacinth Blue—backward in time through three centuries, from its theft by a Nazi officer through the hands of several owners to the studio of the artist himself. In a series of linked stories, Vreeland conveys the private lives and inscrutable emotions for which the mysterious, evocative figure of the painting stands as an emblem. Each story details a domestic drama in which “the momentous ordinary,” in the author’s phrase, is honored and ennobled, even as its characters—a family of Dutch Jews celebrating Passover the year before their deportation; a devoted couple consoled by the embrace of their long marriage; Vermeer’s daughter Magdalena, the model for the girl in the portrait—fall under the sway of history’s calamities and time’s indifference. Like the real paintings that are its inspirations, Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a quietly astonishing articulation of the evanescent emotions that convey enduring human truths.",

        "text": "This book is a remarkable paradox: One of the quirkiest, most original, most poignant books published in the 1990s, its inspiration springs from the blandest of muses—the American suburb. And not the affluently disenchanted sort of community whose emotional tangles have been so lovingly conjured by Cheever and Updike, but rather Lakewood, California, at “the extreme southeast corner of Los Angeles County”—an example of the mass-produced, mid-twentieth-century “new” suburb that’s older than all of them but the original, Levittown, New York. Composed in 316 short bits, some only a sentence or two long, none more than a page, the book details the history of Lakewood’s development, from the financing of the land purchase to the clearing of the plots, the marking off of streets, and the erection of houses in a frenzy of construction efficiency. It is that rarest of testaments, a summoning of spirits both happy and humble, or, as Waldie put it after its publication, “It’s about longing for what you already have.” ",

        "text": "\"Dear God, I am fourteen years old. I am I have always been a good girl. Maybe you can give me a sign letting me know what is happening to me.\" Those words belong to Celie, a poor African American girl in rural Georgia in the 1930s. Her letters, first to God and then to her younger sister, Nettie, make up the largest portion of The Color Purple (letters to Celie from Nettie, who escapes from the South and finds work with a missionary group in Africa, make up the rest). From the outset, the epistolary form of the book creates an intimacy that allows the reader to experience the intense emotions of this searing novel through Celie’s voice, by which she marks off in her letters the only space she can claim as her own within the brutal reality of her life. Although it’s often rightly celebrated for its forthright attention to racism and violence against women, Walker’s book has a moral and emotional power that is not defined solely by specific issues, for Celie’s experience in forging her character in threatening and often terrible situations is as perilous and profound as any soldier’s baptism by fire in a different kind of novel.",

It has been said to be the third most frequently reissued book in the English language (after the Bible and the works of Shakespeare). Walton casts his book in the form of conversations. It begins on the first day of May when three sportsmen meet while walking on a road through the English countryside. As the hunter (Venator), the fowler (Auceps), and the angler (Piscator), compare their recreations, the latter expounds on the merits of fishing in a way that ties the character of his pastime to the quality of his tranquil nature. With Piscator as his spokesman, Walton sings the praises of quiet country living and explains how a true angler is an ideally contemplative and indeed virtuous individual. By trade, Walton was proprietor of a London ironmonger’s shop. Yet he associated with learned men, including the poet John Donne, who, in addition to being the vicar of Walton’s church, also became his friend and fishing companion. The Life and Death of Dr. Donne (1640), written to appear with a collection of Donne’s sermons, launched Walton’s career as one of the first English biographers, a career forever overshadowed by his literary celebration of the angling life.",

Like the most resonant coming-of-age stories, this novel in the form of a diary—covering several months as 1979 turns into 1980—transforms solitude into life-enhancing fictional tidings. Walton’s book is infused with a bit of magic—the kind by which a fictional character becomes a friend for life as her struggles, both great and small, become our own.",

Maxwell and Warner’s happy and profound literary friendship is chronicled in their copious correspondence, collected here in a feast of perception and expression that will delight any devoted reader, even one unfamiliar with the works of the authors. From descriptions of hurricanes, blackouts, and other dramatic occurrences to accountings of mundane matters of domestic aggravation, from rites of private passage to passages of exquisite writing, from details of familial relationships to painstaking tinkerings with the nuts and bolts of literary work, this marvelous volume is an extraordinary testament to the powers and passions of the written word.",

The orphaned siblings live an idealized life under the sole guidance of a grandfather who trusts them enough to let them wander freely through their safe yet adventurous world. The tales are filled with explorations and discoveries, and fine attention to the sort of domestic practicalities—building fires, gathering food, washing up, making camp—that seem magical outside the familiar walls of home. Ideal for family read-alouds for ages five and up.",

        "text": "“A book about crabs? Don’t go away quite yet,” began this book’s original review in the New York Times. Since the title does sound like it could belong to a speech at a particularly boring Chamber of Commerce luncheon, the advice to linger is well placed, for Beautiful Swimmers: Watermen, Crabs and the Chesapeake Bay is wonderfully good reading. Indeed, in 1977, this entertaining, observant, and elegantly composed volume won a Pulitzer Prize and has remained a cult favorite ever since. Combining an environmentalist’s respect for the intricacies of ecosystems, a naturalist’s wonder at curious creatures, and a raconteur’s sense of character and tale-telling (think Rachel Carson meets Annie Dillard meets Joseph Mitchell), Warner’s book is a marvelous account of natural history, human resourcefulness, and the lore and tradition that enhances both.",

        "text": "All the King’s Men has long been regarded as the finest novel about American politics, and rightly so. Robert Penn Warren’s account of the rise and fall of Willie Stark is an absorbing portrait of a self-made populist whose early idealism is corrupted by his gift for getting power and his skill at leveraging it. That Stark’s transformation is as necessary as it is relentless is part of the book’s ruthless intelligence. On his path to the governorship of an unnamed southern state, Stark, whose character and career resemble those of the historical Huey “Kingfish” Long of Louisiana, learns to complement his larger-than-life charms with every opportunistic weapon that his henchmen can point at political enemies (and sometimes friends). Warren’s novel is at its core not just about how power reveals the character of those who wield it, but also about the fickleness of those who cede to them the right to do so. As such, it is a chilling reminder of the precariousness of the commonweal, for Willie Stark, in his charisma as well as his carelessness, represents—as the author himself would put it several years after the novel’s writing—“the kind of doom that democracy may invite upon itself.” Which makes All the King’s Men as relevant now as it’s ever been.",

Washington built, that reads, “He lifted the veil of ignorance from his people and pointed the way to progress through education and industry.” A renowned educator and orator, he lifted that veil not just by ideas and eloquence, but in large degree by hand. As novelist Ishmael Reed writes, introducing one edition of this book, “Washington was a practical man. Up from Slavery is full of practical advice about everything from growing vegetables to selling bricks.” Still, beneath its veneer of common sense and its varnish of experience, Washington’s life story evokes a previously unimaginable future for a people whose present was a prison erected by the past. It continues to teach the lesson that its author learned firsthand: There is no more potent fuel for the engine of idealism than getting things done in the world, and no greater freedom than being ready, willing, and able to get them done on one’s own account.",

Exuding the author’s brash ego, unrelenting drive, and often unchecked opinions, The Double Helix eschews the scholarly decorum readers might expect; nonetheless—or perhaps because of these qualities—it is among the best and most influential books ever written about science. As Nobel Prize-winning physicist and bestselling author Richard P. Feynman observed, Watson’s narrative admirably captures “how it feels to have that frightening and beautiful experience of making a scientific discovery.” In Watson’s own view, that frightening and beautiful experience was an “adventure characterized both by youthful arrogance and by the belief that the truth, once found, would be simple as well as pretty.” Involving numerous personality conflicts and controversies, and, in Watson’s apt assessment, “complicated by the contradictory pulls of ambition and the sense of fair play,” The Double Helix is both the documentary of an invaluable discovery and a riveting human drama.",

One of the best examples of his artistry is The Loved One, a perfect little macabre concoction that lampoons what was once famously called “the American way of death.” Waugh’s black comedy received a notable rave from Wolcott Gibbs, who wrote in The New Yorker, “Never before that I can remember has a talent of such austere and classic design been applied to such monstrous vulgarities. . . . It is certainly a work of art, as rich and subtle and unnerving as anything its author has ever done.”",

It was an event so unimaginable, it left Britain, and indeed the whole of Europe, thunderstruck. Kings had been murdered before, but none had ever been brought to trial by his own people, and, as king still crowned, executed. The remarkable central participants (chief among them, the inscrutable Cromwell and the unshakably dignified, suddenly eloquent monarch); the exciting sequence of events, including, especially, the unprecedented, ill-considered, yet awe-inspiring trial; the shifting hopes and fears of the key factions; the trembling astonishment that seemed to grip the time: These are the elements that Wedgwood brilliantly crafts into a powerful and unforgettable work of narrative history.",

Weil’s essays, letters, and prose meditations are illuminating, enigmatic, and troubling, for they stir up the questions that haunt our own lives, but that, drowned by the business of our days, seldom break the surface of our attention. Reading her brilliant consideration of Homer’s Iliad, “The Poem of Force,” might just change your conception of life, so revelatory is her vision of how violence distorts the mind and constrains its very notion of reality; its consideration of the epic’s moral dimension is profoundly moving, penetrating the mists of antiquity that enshroud the poem to reveal how human strength and cunning first came face-to-face with the ethical imperatives that entwine mortality and morality.",

        "text": "“My fantastic stories,” Wells once wrote, “do not pretend to deal with possible things. They aim indeed only at the same amount of conviction as one gets in a gripping good dream.” That’s certainly an accurate description of the target hit by The Invisible Man—although, by the end of the book, deliciously entertaining as it is, the word “nightmare” might seem more appropriate than “dream.” Who hasn’t imagined what it would be like to roam the world unseen? Like Griffin, the protagonist of Wells’s story, we find it easy to imagine “all that invisibility might mean to a man—the mystery, the power, the freedom.” Also like him—“Drawbacks I saw none”—we are apt to underestimate the downside. Yet drawbacks there are, from the annoyance of pursuing dogs who can still discern his scent to the futility of his physical desires. After the initial exhilaration of its novelty wears off, Griffin’s invisibility grows from liability to curse, while the author shapes a plot that elaborates the clever conceit of an invisible man into a crackerjack cautionary tale of grim and desperate horror.",

Her characters are black and white, young and old, mad and sane; hairdressers, jazz pianists, and traveling salesmen; envious sisters and uncles with questionable impulses; crooks, doctors, and historical figures. One tale is hilarious, the next heart-rending; what they have in common is a magnanimity born of listening closely.",

        "text": "Cultural critic, journalist, and intellectual explorer Lawrence Weschler’s portrayal of the antics and artistry of J. S. G. Boggs is a beguiling true story that poses fascinating questions about the nature of money, our perception of value, and the character of the trust upon which economic transactions are based. A superb reporter and a gifted storyteller with a knack for being in the right place to “[watch] the humdrum suddenly take flight,” Weschler narrates how Boggs’s money mischief has gotten him into serious trouble with the United States Treasury, the Bank of England, and the Australian Federal Currency Squad. The court actions that have resulted raise questions whose answers prove slippery indeed. Once you begin asking what a dollar is, what paper money really represents, and what its exchange for value signifies, the stakes become considerable, both practically and philosophically. And comically, too: The juxtaposition of bureaucracy’s solemnity with Boggs’s high spirits is a delight to savor. As Ira Glass, host of This American Life, said of this offbeat and witty chronicle, “One thing that makes Lawrence Weschler different from most writers is the sheer glee he communicates. This book is a complete pleasure. It’s also a perfect mix of funny and serious.”",

        "text": "To call it a travel book isn’t quite fair: Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is in a class by itself, and the country that is its subject no longer exists as such. (Carved out of the defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Yugoslavia, or “The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,” as it was originally called, subsequently—and violently—broke apart along ethnic and religious lines into half a dozen states.) While author Rebecca West amply conveys the enduring character of the countryside she explores and the cities she visits, including Zagreb and Sarajevo, she also imbues each destination with the “dark waters” of the region’s past. Roiled as they are by ancient ethnic animosities and centuries of political oppression from outside forces, these waters run through West’s pages, bringing “the past side-by-side with the present,” whether she is describing the personalities and attitudes of her Bosnian and Croatian friends, the dresses being sold in an outdoor market, or the image of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, not long before his 1914 assassination, surveying a hall crammed with thousands of stuffed beasts he has killed as a hunter. West composes novelistic set pieces to explore historical events, only to bring us around again to a startling recognition of her present moment—and, even more startlingly, to reveal to twenty-first-century readers a prophetic sense of the future that would unfold in the decades after the book was composed, not only during World War II, but right through the siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s.",

She wrote about the world she knew—New York high society at the turn of the twentieth century, where rules were unbreakable, money was silent, and retribution for social transgression was severe. Her novels are both art and\nespionage. Compared with her earlier novel, The House of Mirth, The Age of Innocence paints a more nuanced and sympathetic portrait of the upper crust, both acknowledging and exposing the machinations that take place behind its genteel façade. It’s a brilliant social critique as well as a sweeping love story. Alongside The House of Mirth, it stands among the best novels ever written about the unraveling of individual destinies in the seductive—and enduring—bear pit of New York society.",

His conversational genius set the enduring tone of The New Yorker in the magazine’s formative years, and his unassumingly authoritative personal essays gave the genre a genuine American accent (see “Death of a Pig” or “Here Is New York,” for starters). White’s command of literary etiquette was so sure, he could even make entertaining a book of grammar and usage instruction (The Elements of Style). In person as in prose, his mastery was modestly worn, and one might easily imagine his taking pleasure in the fact that his legacy will likely rest on the books he wrote for children: Stuart Little (1945), The Trumpet of the Swan (1970), and, especially, Charlotte’s Web, which, like the spider at the center of its enchanting narrative, is in a class by itself. White’s attention to nature’s truths is surpassed only by his allegiance to the human virtues—friendship, constancy, love—that can temper them. Deservedly beloved, Charlotte’s Web is both winning and wise, just like its heroine.",

A simple list of the names it\nencompasses—Arthur and Merlyn, Guenever and Lancelot, Avalon and Camelot—conjures a magical spell of adventure, intrigue, and nobility. No narrative enchanter has made more of its power than T. H. White. In the four novels—The Sword in the Stone, The Queen of Air and Darkness, The Ill-Made Knight, and The Candle in the Wind—collected under the title The Once and Future King, White mined the ore of Arthurian tradition and infused it with both erudition and imagination to create a fresh treasury of humor, romance, fantasy, and tragedy. As we follow Arthur from joyful youth to sorrowful age, the lightheartedness of The Sword in the Stone gives way to the darker currents of the Arthurian indeed, the human—saga, and the glow of Camelot’s glittering aspiration is tarnished with grief. Like a sorcerer worthy of Merlyn’s mantle, White has created a book that grows up before our eyes, imbued with all the wonder and emotions a life can hold.",

White once described his Harvard history professors as “a colony of storytellers,” and he would ultimately make it his profession to be, in his own words, a “storyteller of elections.” Certainly, his reportorial rigor was matched to an artistry that shaped facts into stories with riveting effect, never more than in his study of the Kennedy-Nixon battle, the first of his four Making of the President volumes. Published little more than a half year after the culmination of the events it narrates, White’s account of the 1960 electoral contest between Kennedy and Nixon was a groundbreaking work of political journalism. Offering unusual insight into campaign strategy, demographic trends, and policy issues, and exhibiting zeal for the political process as well as sympathetic appreciation for the personalities of politicians, White’s Pulitzer Prize-winning chronicle was both comprehensive and dramatic.",

Through its brave combination of empathy and invention, it brings a new dimension to the tradition of the slave story, summoning from the atrocities and sufferings of the past the enduring presence that literature can create. History needs fiction to transform it into stories that can speak across generations, rather than remain locked in time. No surprise, then, that The Underground Railroad is also a book about the power of language and the powerlessness that accompanies its loss. Through his own gifts of expression, Whitehead mines such hidden words, fashioning them into a novel that gives voice to the humanity silenced by servitude.",

At the end, he also cites his musical inspirations, mentioning that David Bowie is in every novel, and when he writes the last pages of his books he always plays Sonic Youth and “Purple Rain.” The Underground Railroad has a very musical feel with its interludes and themes.The deeper I got into the novel, the more my admiration grew.

Containing twelve untitled poems and a preface, it caused little stir, except in a reader named Ralph Waldo Emerson, who sent Whitman a letter of high praise. A year later Whitman released a second edition, this time with thirty-three poems (and, unbeknownst to its composer, Emerson’s epistolary endorsement). The poet would continue revising and republishing Leaves of Grass over the next thirty-odd years; the final edition, printed in 1892, by which time the “Good Gray Poet” had become a national treasure, contained 383 poems. His best poems are life-affirming hymns that strike what Abraham Lincoln—whom Whitman mourns in “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d”—once called “the mystic chords of memory.” Few poets have had his influence, and fewer still have so urgently charged the common language of their countrymen.",

First Moishe is expelled from Sighet as a foreigner, only to return to warn his former neighbors of the Gestapo’s deportation and murder of Hungarian Jews. In a world turned upside down, it is the mystic rather than the statesman who bears first witness to the evil onslaught of history. Forty books and a Nobel Peace Prize later, Wiesel's memory became an emblem of what was suffered, lost, and endured in the Holocaust. Nowhere is that commemoration more eloquent than in the pages of Night.",

The artfulness of the gardener’s arrangements will certainly repay study if you are so inclined, but lovely flowers will seduce attention without any especially rigorous effort. The poet’s intellectual reach ramifies from a detailed observation of the natural world, and his prodigious senses of paradox and irony are balanced by an eloquent human sympathy, all set in perfectly poised stanzas of sound and sense. In these pages, readers can also savor Wilbur’s masterful translations of French verse from Molière to Baudelaire, Villon to Mallarmé, as well as samplings from Spanish, Russian, and Italian poets. As a bonus, there are more than one hundred pages of his wonderful poems for children. These allow us to appreciate the poet at play as he puts the precision of his meters and the resourcefulness of his rhymes to work—making words jump, dance, and pose arrestingly; they are pure joy for readers young and old and ideal for reading aloud.",

        "text": "Oscar Wilde’s unparalleled wit outweighs the stature of any of his individual works. His entirely deserved reputation for perfectly pitched comic utterance precedes him, and can, paradoxically, cast a shadow on a reader’s pleasure. Not so with The Importance of Being Earnest, the sparkling play that asks for nothing but a willing suspension of disbelief—the plot piles absurdity upon absurdity as the characters trade names and identities with imaginary offstage figures—and greets it with a fusillade of epigrammatic humor that blends farce, parody, and comedy of manners into a sprightly attack on the poses that prop up social conventions. The plot careens through its perplexities toward a happy resolution, but not before Wilde has, with almost geometrical clarity, plotted an uproariously accurate graph of the lies of convenience and connivance that describe Victorian ideas of propriety, romance, gender, identity, and—not least—earnestness.",

        "text": "At the age of sixty or so, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote a memoir of her upbringing called Pioneer Girl, for which she couldn’t find a publisher. With some advice and guidance from her daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, she recast her memories as a book for young readers, Little House in the Big Woods. A celebration of the resourcefulness and resilience of a settler family, it set the template for seven books to follow, which, together, have earned Wilder and her books enduring popularity—so much so that when Pioneer Girl was finally published in 2014, by the South Dakota State Historical Society, it became a surprise bestseller. That original manuscript depicts a harsh, hardscrabble life—darker, more dangerous, more makeshift and impoverished, and less innocently “can-do” than that depicted in the Little House stories. Reading the original memoir makes it clear how much Wilder invested in reshaping her raw material into a golden age glowing with the virtues of individual agency and self-sufficiency, and a nostalgia for the “sweet, simple things of life” that were never all that sweet and simple—which is to say she sheltered her recollections, like her parents sheltered her, from the violence and vagaries of the frontier. It’s a handmade, homemade world that beguiles young readers with its code of capability, and envelops in a sentimental embrace what is, as Wilder wrote to her daughter, “only the struggle to live, through the winter, until spring comes again.”",

For six years, he knocks “at all the doors in Lima, asking thousands of questions, filling scores of notebooks, in his effort at establishing the fact that each of the five lost lives was a perfect whole.” The stories he unravels become the threads that Wilder weaves into a haunting fabric of fact, fate, and faith.",

        "text": "A summary of what happens in Stoner might well prompt even the most devoted book lover to consider a movie instead. A young farm boy named William Stoner goes off to an agricultural college where he develops a passion for poetry. He embarks on an undistinguished career as an assistant professor of English; his colleagues hold him in no particular esteem. He marries and has a daughter, but his home life becomes a long estrangement from his wife, and fatherhood is fraught with hesitations and mistakes. The hope he discovers in an affair with a colleague is scuttled by university politics. Stoner is “about work, the hard unyielding work of the farms; the work of living within a destructive marriage and bringing up a daughter with patient mutability in a poisoned household; the work of teaching literature to mostly unresponsive students,” writes Irish novelist John McGahern in an introduction to its 2006 reissue. On the face of it, this doesn’t sound inviting. The unexpected power of this unassuming tale is rooted in the way in which the author depicts the concentration of Stoner’s inner being despite the diffusion of his outer life. The cumulative effect of Williams’s unflinching attention to Stoner’s ordinary life is strangely exhilarating—breathtaking, really—in its recognition that our inward selves embrace so much more than our outward lives appear to hold.",

A more romantic or fitting title for the play is hard to conceive: Its juxtaposition of the prosaic and the poetic characterizes both the playwright’s heroine and his theme. From the moment she sets foot in the Kowalskis’ apartment, Blanche commands the stage (until, in the drama’s climactic act of violence, Stanley takes it back). She is very much a performer, and consciously so, whether sneering at Stanley or clutching at the attentions of his friend Mitch. Her desire is an attempt to redeem her distressed circumstances through sentiment, to gain admittance to a wider world than the one at hand through the only resource available to her imagination. Both melodramatic and recognizable, Streetcar's characters are haunting, and Blanche’s ultimate fate harrowing and heartbreaking.",

        "text": "In a famous 1974 essay, philosopher Thomas Nagel wondered, “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” His answer, ultimately, was that we can’t objectively know what the subjective experience of another creature is like. Tarka the Otter asks a similar question—namely, what is it like to be an otter?—but comes up with a rather different answer; to readers, it’s a glorious one. Adopting the methods of imaginative literature rather than those of philosophical analysis, British novelist Henry Williamson provides a vivid, dramatic, and detailed account of the life of an otter in Devon in the west of England. The author works his magic in two principal ways: first, through his uncanny powers of observation, and second, through his lush prose and singular vocabulary. The narrative teems with strange, lovely words drawn from the English countryside: words like uvver, scriddick, turves, ackymal, vair, leat, and oolypuggers. These verbal specimens of natural history startle and inform, giving the narrative a wondrous strangeness that is wholly apt and beguiling.",

        "text": "On November 19, 1863, four and a half months after the fighting on the Gettysburg battlefield had ended, a new cemetery was consecrated there. Among those who gave speeches was President Abraham Lincoln. He wasn’t the main speaker, and he kept his remarks short: 272 words in all, which took no more than three minutes to deliver. But as Wills develops the full story of the speech—its historical moment and its cultural background; its sources, composition, delivery, meaning, and abiding significance—many readers will discover that they don’t know much at all about the words following the first six (some may even be mildly shocked to learn that “Gettysburg” is never mentioned in the Gettysburg Address). Beyond refuting the cherished myth that Lincoln scribbled the address on the back of an envelope on the spur of the moment, the analysis of text and context by the polymathic Wills is so erudite and profound that he justifies his assertion that Abraham Lincoln’s “stunning verbal coup” launched in those few minutes on a November day a second American Revolution.",

Edward O. Wilson—entomologist extraordinaire, master myrmecologist, theorist of sociobiology and champion of biodiversity, twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize—is such a scientist, and a first-rate writer, too. This exceptional autobiography details the shaping of his senses from earliest boyhood. Without literary artifice, but with no lack of style or expressiveness, Wilson brings the scientific imagination to life in a manner both personal and profound. We follow his passion for nature from the beaches of Pensacola and the swamps of Alabama to the cloud forests of the South Pacific, all the while surprised and enlightened by the insights empowered by one man’s attention to insects. His memoir’s intrinsic interest is magnified by the civility, intelligence, and character of its author, qualities that emanate from every page.",

        "text": "As Jay Winik sees it (and as you are likely to see it, too, once you’ve reached the end of his gripping narrative history), April 1865 was “a month that could have unraveled the American nation. Instead, it saved it.” The darkest moment in its calendar of crises was the death of Abraham Lincoln. Since no president had ever been assassinated, there had never been a transfer of presidential power under such precarious circumstances. Further complicating the situation was the fact that the new chief executive, former Vice President Andrew Johnson, had a reputation as a drunkard; he had been so little regarded by Lincoln that the two had met only once since their inaugurations nearly six weeks earlier. There was also General Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox to Union General Ulysses S. Grant as well as Grant’s remarkably generous treatment of the defeated foe. In short, these thirty days—“marked by tumult and bloodshed, heroism and desperation, freedom and defeat, military prowess and diplomatic magnanimity, jubilation and sorrow, and, finally, by individual and national agony and joy”—provide material as weighty as any writer could wish, and Winik does it justice in his engrossing and richly detailed work.",

        "text": "Look Homeward, Angel, Thomas Wolfe's pioneering autobiographical first novel, is set in a town called Altamont, a thinly disguised version of Asheville, North Carolina; it follows the fortunes of Eugene Gant from his difficult birth through childhood, adolescence, sexual awakening, university days, to finally a career as a writer. In ornate, often breathtaking, sometimes unbearably intense prose—in which “the minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death, and every moment is a window on all time”—Wolfe spins an almost mythic tale about hating a home you will long for only after you leave, and about forging a career as an artist in defiance of family expectation. Wolfe gave voice to an American experience that had not yet been put down in prose, driven by a sense of purpose both quixotic and noble.",

        "text": "What’s most impressive about Wolfe’s rollicking fictional tour of New York in the 1980s is its vigor. He depicts so many facets of the city’s life: Park Avenue and Wall Street and their social and financial scheming; inner city housing projects and their attendant miseries and machinations; the personal and political confusions of the criminal courts; the vapid, venal power of the media. Each slice of life is drawn and quartered with a wicked pen. Give Wolfe a shoe, an architectural detail, or a verbal inflection and he’ll turn it into a satiric weapon sharpened by insight. This is the novel as comic romp, riffing on observable reality with an intelligence that is both precise and completely over the top. There may be no psychological depth here, but that, in part, is the author’s very subject. His furiously paced, hilariously funny novel is an ideal witness to the sad comedy of a metropolis cowering behind the shattering glass of its glittering and glowering façades.",

Woolf’s essays are legion, and they have been collected and regrouped in any number of individual volumes. Start with the pieces the author gathered in two volumes and called The\nCommon Reader, in which Woolf assembles a refined personal library. Scholarship takes a back seat to serendipity, education seems—as it should—a circuit of enthusiasms, and a serious mind finds its shape among the sentences and sentiments that speak most directly to it. In these engaging volumes, Woolf develops her understanding while the reader learns valuable lessons about Chaucer and the Elizabethans, Montaigne and Defoe, Joseph Addison and Jane Austen, the Brontës and George Eliot. Of special note are the essays “On Not Knowing Greek” and “How It Strikes a Contemporary” (in the first volume), and “How Should One Read a Book?” (in the second). Making their acquaintance, one gains insight not only into reading, but into thinking and being as well.",

Set at the Ramsay family’s summer home on the Isle of Skye, the story of To the Lighthouse is told in three parts. But “story,” of course, is the wrong word, for the book unfolds not so much by the author’s telling of events as by her seamless movement from the mind of one character to that of another, then another, then another, passing like a benevolent ghost between the prompts of perception and the chaotic and redemptive reveries of consciousness. The reader who gives in to the pull of Woolf’s prose enters a realm in which words transcend both plot and description to communicate with an unparalleled directness the beauties and sorrows of time, loss, love, friendship, custom, art.",

She wrote through the births and deaths of friends and relations, and through bouts of her own madness. She recorded details of weather and war, of her own writing and the shared work with which she and her husband, Leonard, built their Hogarth Press, of house-hunting, of who said what at dinner. Woolf was the brightest star in the constellation known as Bloomsbury, and the “who” that came to dinner encompassed John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster, Vita Sackville-West, and Lytton Strachey. Many other luminaries pass through these pages, including Sigmund Freud, who, with Freudian slipperiness, presents Woolf with a narcissus. Most memorable in these diary entries is the alertness with which Woolf perceives all about her, from mundane domestic arrangements to dramatic personal doubts and crises.",

Orlando grows up as a young nobleman in thrall to love and literature, travels as an ambassador to the Ottoman court in Constantinople, returns to the England of Pope and Dryden, and enters and exits the Victorian era, having achieved in the end the ripe old age of thirty. Traversing more than the borders of nations and centuries, Orlando is transformed along the way from hero to heroine, a willing victim of the author’s exuberant invention as Woolf engages, with playful abandon, themes of gender, biography, writing, and desire. Written in tribute to her friend and lover Vita Sackville-West, Woolf’s biographical fantasy is a delicious celebration of the exhilarating powers of infatuation and imagination.",

        "text": "In poem after poem—from his lyrical ballads and eloquent sonnets to his magnificent longer poems, such as “Tintern Abbey” and “Ode: Intimations of Immortality”—Wordsworth enriches his experience by reflecting upon it in solitude. Retrospect is Wordsworth’s medium, and he may well be said to have invented it, and perhaps solitude itself, as a dimension of the literary imagination. His achievement is so large, so pervasive in its influence, that we are in danger of barely noticing it today. But much of the most inventive literature created in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, aptly enough, looks back to him. In The Prelude’s thousands of pentameters, Wordsworth charts the fears and fabrications, the habits and the intuitions, the shaping processes and private emanations of the self, in a way that no seer had previously envisioned; in his pages the human imagination comes to life as a natural resource worth the work and wonder of cultivation.",

What fuels the enduring power of Native Son is the bruising ugliness of the story it tells, and its recognition that the ugliness cannot be mitigated by goodwill. In the brutality of Bigger Thomas and his experience, Wright gives ominous reality to the present horror of America’s tragic past of oppression. Bigger’s yearning for “a wider choice of action” is the desire for a story different from the one he is allowed to imagine for himself. Native Son tells us that, given the injustice and deprivation that have shaped black experience in America, there may be no other story available to him.",

Detailing with verve and erudition Humboldt’s exploits as an explorer in far-flung corners of the world, Wulf also reveals the extraordinary extent of his reputation in his own lifetime. In his day (born in 1769, he died ninety years later), he was the most famous scientist in the world and an international celebrity. This long, rich, information-packed biography repays leisurely attention at the same time as it stimulates one’s thinking about fundamental issues. “Humboldt was not so much interested in finding new isolated facts but in connecting them,” Wulf writes. A reader can thankfully say the same of the author of this delightful book.",

Yet, the novel exudes a holiday air, a sense of liberation from artificial constraints and social falsities, and seemingly welcomes the prospect of a fresh relaunch of civilization and its contents. The fate of the masses might be horrific, but the plucky survivors on whom the narrative instinctively focuses will inherit a planet full of treasures, both natural and man-made, and—just maybe—find beyond the dark days of collapse a new Golden Age. And, of course, over all looms the menace of the rampant triffids, carnivorous plants with an urgent hunger that gives their energy what appears to be a malevolent intelligence. These inspired inventions give Wyndham’s book a creepily delightful, uncannily titillating appeal.",

Zoom’s search leads him to his uncle’s friend Maria, a woman whose house holds not only the ocean (as we discover in Zoom at Sea), but also—up near the attic—the North Pole (Zoom Away), and—behind the books in the library—Egypt and the Nile (Zoom Upstream).

        "text": "In the year before his assassination, Malcolm X enlisted journalist Alex Haley, who had interviewed him for Playboy in 1963, to write his autobiography. Haley crafted the book from extensive taped conversations. “A writer is what I want,” Haley quotes Malcolm as saying, “not an interpreter,” and the first-person voice of the narrative is electric, unflinching, unforgettable in its honesty, fraught with the power that made Malcolm X the Nation of Islam’s most effective speaker and organizer for a decade before his acrimonious split with Elijah Muhammad in 1964. On every page, one man’s struggle toward a higher calling is given vivid context by reference to the ordinary and extraordinary attentions of the narrator’s life: the pain of prejudice both passing and violent, the joys of dancing the Lindy, the logistics of a street hustle or a robbery, the liberating vistas of a library (even in prison), the pride inherent in the careful refiguring of Jackie Robinson’s batting average “up through his last turn at bat.” In the reading, The Autobiography of Malcolm X remains riveting—as intense, honest, alert, dangerous, provocative, surprising, and complex as the man whose life it tells.",

        "text": "Publius Aelius Traianus Hadrianus (AD 76–AD 138) was emperor of Rome from AD 117 to AD 138. Hadrian, as he is known in English, is generally regarded as the most intellectual and cultivated of all the Roman emperors. In her celebrated Memoirs of Hadrian, Marguerite Yourcenar reinforces the impression that Hadrian’s fascinating life had the shape and substance of a work of art. Drawn with scholarly exactitude and imaginative sympathy from extant writings by Hadrian as well as by his contemporaries (both friends and enemies) and from the work of latter-day historians, this marvelous “autobiography” is, in Yourcenar’s words, both a “psychological novel and meditation on history.” Written in the form of a letter from Hadrian to his eventual successor, Marcus Aurelius, the emperor looks back over his formative decades and his years in power, recalling both personal affections (his love for the boy Antinous) and public actions (the destruction of Jerusalem). Ranked among the most adroit and persuasive evocations of antiquity, Memoirs of Hadrian is a learned, compelling, and credible reconstruction of the life of emperor and era, written in prose of measured majesty.",

Zee begins with the characters on a restaurant menu: These striking graphic symbols, alluring even to the untrained eye, cache tradition, folklore, and history. They create a visual poetry unknown in alphabetic scripts, a mysterious encoding that Zee explicates by revealing the ancient pictographs at their root. You’ll never look at Chicken Ding in Brown Sauce or Hot and Sour Soup (not to mention Woman Song’s Fish Broth or Buddha Jumping Over the Wall) in the same way again; more important, you’ll never look at language in quite the same way either. “I will consider the book a success,” the author confides, “if I manage to confuse bookstore owners and librarians about where to put the book. The only solution, ladies and gentlemen, is to put it in all three sections—culture, language, and food.” He’s absolutely right.",

Any kid who had gone to the trouble of putting a whole continent between himself and his family could count on their never showing up at his doorstep.” Any mother who would make the trip—a transcontinental flight, a six-hour bus ride to the end of the line, then a journey by bush plane into a densely forested nowhere—is clearly a force to be reckoned with, and the reckoning between parent and child that Within This Wilderness witnesses takes on, because of its remote setting, an archetypal resonance. Indeed, both the awesome natural charms of the surroundings and the hard manner of living that isolation dictates engage and even relax our attention, protecting us for a time from the climate of deep emotion in which the protagonists dwell. Ziner’s deft portrayal of the elaborate, often comic diplomacy of the relations between parents and grown children, her sensitivity to the alarming innocence of the toughest youth, and her splendid writing reward the reader throughout, and her unstinting appraisal of her own noble confusion—a spell of love, worry, wonder, guilt, loss, pride, anxiety, anger, obligation, yearning—is both moving and magnanimous.",

And Émile Zola, the engineer of literary naturalism in nineteenth-century France, was nothing if not ambitious. He wanted to capture in prose the entirety of French society—rich and poor, urban and rural—under the Second Empire. The outstanding novel of Zola’s cycle is Germinal, a gritty portrayal of a coal miners’ strike in northern France in the 1860s. Germinal, with its unsparing look at lives and labors of the working class, is an exceptionally gripping novel. In the darkness of the coal pits it illuminates signal battles of the coming age: between labor and capital, between nature and industry, and between the promise of socialism and the hazards of its practice. The author’s contemporaries certainly bore witness to its impact: When Zola died in Paris in 1902, crowds followed his coffin as a parade carried it to the Montmartre cemetery. As the cortège passed, they shouted one word: “Germinal!”",

Carl Zuckmayer was one of the finest playwrights (The Captain of Köpenick) and screenwriters (The Blue Angel) of Weimar Germany, whose literary, theatrical, and cinematic achievements met with accolades and awards throughout the middle decades of the twentieth century. You may at first wonder what the story of his life has to offer. You won’t be many pages into A Part of Myself before you stop asking. His book is a beautiful narrative of childhood and youth, of the horrors of the First World War, of heady early success in the theater, of the encroaching terror of World War II as it destroyed a world of great human substance and dignity. Forced by the Nazis to flee his homeland, he became an exile in America, working first as a Hollywood screenwriter and later as a Vermont farmer. He returned to Europe after the defeat of Hitler. Filled with culture and compassion, and with noble friendships (celebrated ones, too: Bertolt Brecht, Marlene Dietrich, Ernest Hemingway, and theater impresario Max Reinhardt are among the notables summoned by Zuckmayer’s recollections), this portrait of an epoch is also one of its more exquisite monuments.",
